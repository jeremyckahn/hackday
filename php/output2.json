(their first EP title) The band relocated to Whittier, California and began recording their first demos, which, when released in spring 2005, ultimately became known as the Mulberry Street EP. Between tours, the band released two more EPs: With Our Wallets Full and Up in Rags, in 2006. In summer 2006, Cold War Kids signed to Downtown Records (home to Gnarls Barkley, Art Brut) and released their debut LP Robbers & Cowards that fall.\n<br /><br />\nAfter two years of non-stop touring around the world, and relocation to Long Beach, California, Cold War Kids went back into the studio spring 2008 with the producer of their first record Kevin Augunas. Nathan described the record making process: “Throughout the record making process we would write songs in our own little practice studio then we’d go into the studio for like two days and record three or four songs, then go back into our own practice studio for like a few weeks. So really it was over the span of four months or something. Actual studio days probably like 15 days. We don’t love being in a studio; we focus more on the writing.”\n<br /><br />\nThe band's second album, Loyalty to Loyalty, represented a departure from their debut in featuring a lot of narrative storytelling, as well as political and philosophical references. In an interview with Blackbox Magazine, Nathan described the record as “Being a little darker then the first.\" \"The title, 'Loyalty to Loyalty,' comes from the philosopher Josiah Royce. He said people need to live in community with each other, and he was reacting to Nietzsche who came before him, saying people need to rise above—you need to be the strongest individual you can and rise above the masses. But this guy Josiah Royce is saying that you need to not rise above the masses, that you need to embrace your community. His paper was called 'Loyalty to Loyalty.'”\n<br /><br />\nThe band spent the end of 2008 and most of 2009 on the road touring the record, highlighted by a national tour with Death Cab for Cutie. In between touring, the band returned to the studio to record what would become the Behave Yourself EP. Willett describes the album, “These 4 songs were recorded sometime between “Loyalty” sessions and now. They didn’t belong there but they kept hanging around, starting trouble, made friends and insisted their story be heard.” Like their most recent releases, Behave Yourself was released on Downtown Records.\n<br /><br />\nThe band went back into the studio in February 2010. Nathan speaking to Filter Magazine, “Album three is in the works now. We are working with a producer named Jacquire King. He has a sweet and eclectic roster of Modest Mouse, the last Norah Jones record, Tom Waits’ Mule Variations, the last Kings of Leon record...So, he is going to work miracles with us. All of our music has always been written entirely by us without any influence, so to have him step in and help us with the direction is tremendous. I was just watching the Wilco Documentary again and I think that in many ways Wilco is to country/Americana as Cold War Kids is to soul/punk. We are taking what we do to the next level on this record. The EP is the final reminder of the good old days of quick and fun, minimal Cold War Kids recording.\"","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/cold-war-kids","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Cold War Kids started in 2004 in downtown Fullerton in guitarist/vocalist Jonnie Russell's apartment above the restaurant Mulberry Street.

He’s become the most buzz-worthy current Reggae artist over the past few years. In the summer, 2007, Collie Buddz’ Columbia Records self-titled debut album stormed the charts entering the Billboard Reggae Chart at first position. The Reggae singjay became an international star when this album then went on to debut across the world at the top of every chart from Japan to Germany. With much of the production coming from Collie himself, he delivered a solid debut with contributions from Supa Dups, Shea Taylor, Bang Out, Screwface, Bobby Konders and Crown N Kah-So-Real to name just a few. Released just a day before US Independence Day, Collie’s debut album could be heard blasting out of car windows from Brooklyn to Kingston all summer long. Critically speaking, Collie’s debut was a monster. Speaking of his first single, an undeniable summer anthem titled, “Come Around,” Source Magazine proclaimed, “This 24 year old shotta has got an anthem spreading across the seas.” “The song is a monster,” claimed Miami New Times. And, Hip Hop Weekly said, “Collie Buddz is one of the most firmly grounded voices you may ever encounter.” The industry excitement about this new voice in music manifested in many ways namely by inspiring Collie’s musical peers to either create their own remixes of “Come Around,” or join Collie on the official remix of the single. Everyone from Busta Rhymes, Cypress Hill and Paul Wall to G-Unit and Shaggy contributed to the anthem.\n<br><br>\nIncorporating influences from Hip-Hop to Soca, Collie’s music nevertheless has a rock-solid foundation in Reggae - and its power to connect ghetto reality with the highest heights of human aspiration - that is a rarity even in Jamaica. But, to say he’s connected to the Caribbean community would be an understatement. Collie Buddz, born Colin Harper, has become the Caribbean culture’s resident ambassador.\n<br><br>\nTouring extensively, Collie’s passport stamps are a relative reflection of the worldwide love for Reggae and Caribbean culture. From Madison Square Garden to Dubai, Collie Buddz is the definition of an international recording artist. “It was crazy performing in the Middle East. Who would have guessed how big reggae music is there? They knew all my songs,” a jubilant Collie Buddz explains. He has toured throughout Germany, France, England, Japan, North and South America and the Caribbean. His unique blend of Hip-Hop, Soca and Dancehall underlined with his ever-present passion for the modern Roots Reggae sound has attracted tastemaker supporters all over the world. Reggae pioneer David Rodigan [London] and New York Reggae stalwarts at legendary radio station, Hot 97, Massive B and Short-Man [Heavy Hitters] are just some of his most ardent supporters. Now on the verge of Collie’s sophomore album release, the anticipation is palpable.\n<br><br>\nIn spite of averaging an eleven month yearly touring schedule since 2007, Collie Buddz is prepared to release a sophomore album that promises an even greater insight into the multi-talented, producer/singer-songwriter/performer. He’s also made time to work with some of the most respected producers and artists in the industry while also making beautiful music with the production team that made his debut album an overnight success. “We don’t have a title for the new album just yet but whatever we call it, the album will be mad,” Collie excitedly explains. With production by Supa Dups, Massive B and Seanie B among other contributors, Collie’s fans can anticipate Collie’s unique twist on popular music. Tony Kelly [K-Licious], producer of more crossover hits than any other producer in the genre [Sean Paul, Patra, Supercat, Wayne Wonder, Shaggy] and TJ Records [Beenie Man] return with production for this album as well. Among friends, Collie is known as a “studio rat,” as given any sort of free time in the schedule, Collie is hunkered down behind the boards of a recording studio. So it comes to no surprise to anyone that Collie is also ready to release a brand new mixtape. \n<br><br>\n“I was just in Los Angeles finishing a song with Sugar Ray, and I love the vibe on that track,” says Collie of the new mixtape. Also with verses on hit songs by Beyonce, Rihanna and Kid Cudi, the mixtape is sure to give Collie’s fans an appetizer to the entrée of the sophomore album. “I always want to give all the sound-systems and DJs something to rock the clubs with while I work on releasing my new material,” Collie says. It is this love for constantly creating that drives Collie Buddz. \n<br><br>\nWanting to release music more frequently and with fewer restrictions, Collie’s affiliation with Columbia Records/Sony Music Entertainment, Inc ended in 2008. He has since founded his own independent record label, Harper Digital alongside his brother [Smokey] and DJ [DJ Genie] while working with his longtime management group, Mojiza Management. The Harper Digital team is already grooming the label into a full production house and artist development business. Humble as always, Collie simply says, “I’m just excited to be putting out another album. I love to make music and the satisfaction is in having other people from all over the world enjoy it. I live out of a suitcase and I wouldn’t have it any other way.” And Collie means just what he says.\n<br><br>\nWith a nonstop touring schedule with his band The New Kingston Band and his longtime compatriot and hype man, Pee Wee, Collie just has one quick stop before hitting the road yet again. He’s got to stop by the embassy and pick up more page inserts for his passport.","hometown":"Bermuda","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/collie-buddz","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Collie Buddz, from the isle of Bermuda, has done something not impossible but something once seemingly very implausible.

If so, then it’s hard to imagine a band pushing that manifesto further than Cults. On the surface they could be sickly sweet – a smitten duo called Brian Oblivion and Madeline Follin who spin gorgeous melodies across their girl group-inspired bedroom pop. But dig deeper and a whole new world opens up, one that contains songs about apprehension, substance abuse and the pain of moving from adolescence into adulthood. Oh, and those inspirational, moving speeches that appear, ghost-like, behind the music? They’re from a selection of notorious cult leaders …\n <br /><br />\n“I think what makes something beautiful is when it’s pretty but there’s something wrong with it too,” muses Brian. “So where our music is upbeat and uplifting, behind that there are heartbreaking lyrics and quotes from Charles Manson, Patty Hearst, Jim Jones … I wanted quotes of ugly people saying beautiful things.

But dig deeper and a whole new world opens up, one that contains songs about apprehension, substance abuse and the pain of moving from adolescence into adulthood.

They’re from a selection of notorious cult leaders …\n <br /><br />\n“I think what makes something beautiful is when it’s pretty but there’s something wrong with it too,” muses Brian. “So where our music is upbeat and uplifting, behind that there are heartbreaking lyrics and quotes from Charles Manson, Patty Hearst, Jim Jones … I wanted quotes of ugly people saying beautiful things.

He continues to work in the studio, readying his next solo album, continues to tour as a way of both entertaining and healing, continues to spread the message for those whose voices cannot be heard, and continues to look for the next challenge.","musicbrainz_id":null},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14867/sq_90.JPG","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14867/original.JPG","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/23377.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"6","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"2"}},"main_lineup_position":"300","twitter_username":"deadmau5","setlist":null,"title":"Deadmau5","updated_at":"2011-05-05 19:44:56 -0500","youtube_id":"y7tI1E6kp0o","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/101469.json","title":"Skrillex"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/44130.json","title":"Pretty Lights"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/7193.json","title":"Crystal Castles"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/51618.json","title":"12th Planet"}]},"flickr_tag":"deadmau5","id":"23377","echonest_id":"ARJS9GN1187FB578C4","homepage":"http://www.deadmau5.com/","myspace_link":null,"fan_count":"9975","description":"Joel Zimmerman doesn’t like being called a DJ.

As chart-toppers and headliners, they’ve crossed over genres, defied categorization and confused the hell out of your iPod (“Heavy Metal?” “Hard Rock?” “Alternative?”) Above all, Deftones have stuck together throughout their often-turbulent tenure, and now, deliver one of the most compelling records of their career.\n<br /><br />\nThe 11-track album is just that—an album from start to finish. Diamond Eyes works the way good records used to; each song carries you a little further away from your shitty day until finally, you’ve been transported to a place that feels a whole lot better than where you started. “There are so many emotions that music can give you, and if you explore all sides of those, it can be really amazing,” says Moreno. “Like sadness -- it can be really lovely, or beautiful, or wide open, or coarse. We connect with different emotions because we listen to everything out there—that could mean dumb music or something by Brian Eno. Then when we play, it’s not a real conscious thing, but the emotion builds and it takes us in a lot of different ways. I think that’s what music’s supposed to do.”\n<br /><br />\nThe tangle of Stephen Carpenter’s woozy, undulating guitar work and Moreno’s soaring then secretive vocal style is the bittersweet dynamic behind each of Deftones' records, including Diamond Eyes. The friction drives the music as much as it does the players, though it doesn’t always make life easy for childhood friends Carpenter and Moreno. “What makes us work?” asks Carpenter. “Chino will give you the exact opposite answer that I do. That’s the way it is with us—we contradict each other constantly but it’s also what makes our music what it is—intense and different.”\n<br /><br />\nThere’s also a newfound sense of purpose that makes Deftones' sixth album stand out. The band recorded the album after their best friend and bassist Chi Cheng sustained a debilitating brain injury from a car accident in November of 2008. “After Chi’s accident, it would have been easy for us to make a sad record,” says Moreno. “It felt like there was a cloud around us, so we aimed to make something uplifting. I think that’s why there’s a lot of fantasy stuff on the record. I tried to take it away from day to day life, and make it more about the abstract, about art. It sounds odd, but really, this is an optimistic record.” And a spontaneous one.\n<br /><br />\nDiamond Eyes was made in a mere six months with the help of former Quicksand bassist Sergio Vega and producer Nick Raskulinecz of Foo Fighters, Alice In Chains, and Rush fame. Oddly enough, Deftones had just come off recording another full album, Eros, which they ultimately shelved. Moreno says, “Honestly, I knew there was something better to come.” Starting over was a bold move considering Deftones traditionally take their time writing and recording each album. Drummer Abe Cunningham was concerned about the decision, especially since it had been so difficult making records in the past. “Each one was getting to be like pulling teeth, and beyond—maybe like surgery without anesthesia,” he adds. “But this time, we just said fuck it, we’re still best friends, all of us -- and we’re still able to do this. So we just lightened up and got creative, and we’re firing on all cylinders.”\n<br /><br />\nThese days, Deftones are far more unified than ever before, but that hasn’t always been the case. Tensions began to mount following their breakthrough record “White Pony” in 2000.  It was their first to top the Billboard charts, win a Grammy and earn Platinum certification.  In the wake of their success, the band toured nonstop; a grueling schedule that gave way to 24/7 road-life, in-fighting, and eventually, burnout. Carpenter and Moreno’s disputation over the direction of music escalated to the point where the pair stopped speaking all together. By the time their 2003 self-titled album was release, Cunningham says they all had their nicknames for the difficult period in which it was recorded. “Steph calls it the Downward Spiral. I refer to it as Dark Days.” The conflict made the band’s life hell, but it gave the music press something to write about in the stretch between albums. “A lot of that was trumped up, but we’ve definitely had some heavy times,” says keyboardist Frank Delgado, who joined the band originally as a turntableist in the mid 90s.  “Still one of the best things about this band is that we just don’t give up. As dysfunctional as it can be, we still make it work. And I really don’t know what the press thinks of us now, but I like that. There should be some mysticism there. Maybe they should think we’re off our rocker.” And deconstructing the band’s mental state is an easy task compared to categorizing the music they make.\n<br /><br />\nCritics, marketers and radio alike have struggled with just where to place or how to define Deftones. They band has, after all, played with punk rockers L7, toured with Metallica and appealed to some of the same fan base as Morrissey and generally defied simple, and ultimately pointless  genre classification. “We’re not a party band, but we’re not a dark rock band,” says Moreno. “We’re not the most wildly artistic band, but we’re not light and fluffy. It’s hard to put us in one place. I don’t blame people when they try to do it, because I can’t even pin it myself. But really, does it matter?”  Not when you’re as compelling, diverse, powerful and pretty as Deftones.","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/deftones","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"“Pretty,” affirms Deftones singer and guitarist Chino Moreno when discussing their new full-length studio album, Diamond Eyes.  “We’re not afraid to be pretty.” It’s an adjective most riff-heavy groups might avoid, but then, Deftones have never been your average hard rock band.\n<br /><br />\nAs kids, the Sacramento fivesome cut its teeth on Anthrax and The Smiths, Pantera and The Cure, skateboarding and “The Smurfs.” As a band out of high school, Deftones mixed trip hop with thrash, melodic vocals with crushing reverb, and yes, pretty with ugly.

Diamond Eyes works the way good records used to; each song carries you a little further away from your shitty day until finally, you’ve been transported to a place that feels a whole lot better than where you started. “There are so many emotions that music can give you, and if you explore all sides of those, it can be really amazing,” says Moreno. “Like sadness -- it can be really lovely, or beautiful, or wide open, or coarse. We connect with different emotions because we listen to everything out there—that could mean dumb music or something by Brian Eno. Then when we play, it’s not a real conscious thing, but the emotion builds and it takes us in a lot of different ways. I think that’s what music’s supposed to do.”\n<br /><br />\nThe tangle of Stephen Carpenter’s woozy, undulating guitar work and Moreno’s soaring then secretive vocal style is the bittersweet dynamic behind each of Deftones' records, including Diamond Eyes. The friction drives the music as much as it does the players, though it doesn’t always make life easy for childhood friends Carpenter and Moreno. “What makes us work?” asks Carpenter. “Chino will give you the exact opposite answer that I do. That’s the way it is with us—we contradict each other constantly but it’s also what makes our music what it is—intense and different.”\n<br /><br />\nThere’s also a newfound sense of purpose that makes Deftones' sixth album stand out. The band recorded the album after their best friend and bassist Chi Cheng sustained a debilitating brain injury from a car accident in November of 2008. “After Chi’s accident, it would have been easy for us to make a sad record,” says Moreno. “It felt like there was a cloud around us, so we aimed to make something uplifting. I think that’s why there’s a lot of fantasy stuff on the record. I tried to take it away from day to day life, and make it more about the abstract, about art. It sounds odd, but really, this is an optimistic record.” And a spontaneous one.\n<br /><br />\nDiamond Eyes was made in a mere six months with the help of former Quicksand bassist Sergio Vega and producer Nick Raskulinecz of Foo Fighters, Alice In Chains, and Rush fame. Oddly enough, Deftones had just come off recording another full album, Eros, which they ultimately shelved. Moreno says, “Honestly, I knew there was something better to come.” Starting over was a bold move considering Deftones traditionally take their time writing and recording each album. Drummer Abe Cunningham was concerned about the decision, especially since it had been so difficult making records in the past. “Each one was getting to be like pulling teeth, and beyond—maybe like surgery without anesthesia,” he adds. “But this time, we just said fuck it, we’re still best friends, all of us -- and we’re still able to do this. So we just lightened up and got creative, and we’re firing on all cylinders.”\n<br /><br />\nThese days, Deftones are far more unified than ever before, but that hasn’t always been the case. Tensions began to mount following their breakthrough record “White Pony” in 2000.  It was their first to top the Billboard charts, win a Grammy and earn Platinum certification.  In the wake of their success, the band toured nonstop; a grueling schedule that gave way to 24/7 road-life, in-fighting, and eventually, burnout. Carpenter and Moreno’s disputation over the direction of music escalated to the point where the pair stopped speaking all together. By the time their 2003 self-titled album was release, Cunningham says they all had their nicknames for the difficult period in which it was recorded. “Steph calls it the Downward Spiral. I refer to it as Dark Days.” The conflict made the band’s life hell, but it gave the music press something to write about in the stretch between albums. “A lot of that was trumped up, but we’ve definitely had some heavy times,” says keyboardist Frank Delgado, who joined the band originally as a turntableist in the mid 90s.  “Still one of the best things about this band is that we just don’t give up. As dysfunctional as it can be, we still make it work. And I really don’t know what the press thinks of us now, but I like that. There should be some mysticism there. Maybe they should think we’re off our rocker.” And deconstructing the band’s mental state is an easy task compared to categorizing the music they make.\n<br /><br />\nCritics, marketers and radio alike have struggled with just where to place or how to define Deftones. They band has, after all, played with punk rockers L7, toured with Metallica and appealed to some of the same fan base as Morrissey and generally defied simple, and ultimately pointless  genre classification. “We’re not a party band, but we’re not a dark rock band,” says Moreno. “We’re not the most wildly artistic band, but we’re not light and fluffy. It’s hard to put us in one place. I don’t blame people when they try to do it, because I can’t even pin it myself. But really, does it matter?”  Not when you’re as compelling, diverse, powerful and pretty as Deftones.","musicbrainz_id":null},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14896/sq_90.jpg","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14896/original.jpg","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/9675.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"33","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"4"}},"main_lineup_position":"1600","twitter_username":"deltaspirit","setlist":null,"title":"Delta Spirit","updated_at":"2011-05-18 01:59:34 -0500","youtube_id":"8IlZCz4xqa8","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/34489.json","title":"My Morning Jacket"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/9675.json","title":"Delta Spirit"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/52924.json","title":"Smith Westerns"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/58836.json","title":"Two Door Cinema Club"}]},"flickr_tag":"deltaspirit","id":"9675","echonest_id":"AR23YR81187FB5814F","homepage":"http://deltaspirit.net/","myspace_link":null,"fan_count":"1804","description":"We played something like 290 shows in the last 2 years.

Later, they connected with bassist Erik and guitarist Cosmo, and the finished project sounded more like a jangle pop mixtape left on your dashboard on hot summer day.\n<br /><br />\nWith warped vocals, fuzzy low-fi distortion, and broken Casio keyboard lines, Dom filters a DIY aesthetic through the upbeat, sunny rhythms of pop music. There’s a MacGyverized style to Dom buzzed-about debut EP Sun Bronzed Greek Gods, the seven songs feel like they’re held together by sonic duct tape. At any minute they could break apart. But they don’t. These tracks recorded in Erik’s bedroom—on a pink paisley guitar, a Casio and Fruity Loops—are solid, edgy and irresistibly fun. “We like to get gnarly, but that doesn’t mean we’re a joke,” Dom says.\n<br /><br />\nBy March they were playing frenzied basement shows on the East Coast, and by April DOM was featured as a rising band on tastemaking music site, Pitchfork. Then the buzzing began.\n<br /><br />\nYet, inside the breezy pop of Dom, is Dom, the man, whose personal history is decidedly less carefree. He doesn’t want you to dwell on his past, but to understand Dom today, you have to excavate the skeletons hidden deep in Dom’s closet. After all, pop music is escapism; it’s a drug, a candy-coated antidote to pain. Unfortunately for Dom, pain has followed him like a shadow through life.\n<br /><br />\nWhen Dom was 8 years old, his mother gave him up for adoption. At an age where he was all-too conscious, Dom was devastated by this breach of trust and schism from his family. His siblings stayed with his mom, he was the only one to go. Unanswered questions reverberated in the back of Dom’s brain: Why him? What made Dom so different?\n<br /><br />\nLike so many children in foster homes, Dom bounced from family to family, searching for permanent place to call home. \n<br /><br />\nAcclimating to these temporary families was impossible, and when Dom was 14 he got into a serious fight with a foster brother. Dom was arrested in the school cafeteria in front of his friends. He was locked up for a few months and became subsumed in the cycle of within America’s ailing juvenile justice system.\n<br /><br />\nDislocated in life, he found a home in music.\n<br /><br />\n“When I was a kid my mom listened to Roy Orbison, and I remember wanting to be him. I was told I couldn’t be him. So later I had this dream that if I could be him someday, I would be somebody, and maybe my mom could see that,” Dom says.\n<br /><br />\nDom’s personal troubles add a caustic irony to the feel good lyrics on Sun Bronzed Greek Gods. “It’s so sexy/ to be living in America” he sings on “Living in America.” On “Burn Bridges,” he explains, “Burn your bridges / make yourself an island / Just forgive ‘em and forget ‘em.”\n<br /><br />\nOn Dom island, music is the cure. It’s the reason to pick up those broken pieces of your life and move on. Dom says forget that baggage, fuck the past, and rock for now.\n<br /><br />\n“I’m gonna live how I want to/ This is okay/ I’ve been living for today.” – Dom.","hometown":"worcester madrid, Massachusetts, United States","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/dom","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"While many bands suffer with identity crises, Worchester, Massachusetts four-piece Dom has their priorities straight. “We want to be the Lady Gaga of garage rock,” proclaims Dominic, the 23-year-old mastermind behind the buzzed-about twisted-pop rockers, who have stampeded into music world consciousness like a herd of irritable rhinos.\n<br /><br />\nIf it seems like Dom just came out of nowhere, that is because they did.

These tracks recorded in Erik’s bedroom—on a pink paisley guitar, a Casio and Fruity Loops—are solid, edgy and irresistibly fun. “We like to get gnarly, but that doesn’t mean we’re a joke,” Dom says.\n<br /><br />\nBy March they were playing frenzied basement shows on the East Coast, and by April DOM was featured as a rising band on tastemaking music site, Pitchfork. Then the buzzing began.\n<br /><br />\nYet, inside the breezy pop of Dom, is Dom, the man, whose personal history is decidedly less carefree. He doesn’t want you to dwell on his past, but to understand Dom today, you have to excavate the skeletons hidden deep in Dom’s closet. After all, pop music is escapism; it’s a drug, a candy-coated antidote to pain. Unfortunately for Dom, pain has followed him like a shadow through life.\n<br /><br />\nWhen Dom was 8 years old, his mother gave him up for adoption. At an age where he was all-too conscious, Dom was devastated by this breach of trust and schism from his family. His siblings stayed with his mom, he was the only one to go. Unanswered questions reverberated in the back of Dom’s brain: Why him? What made Dom so different?\n<br /><br />\nLike so many children in foster homes, Dom bounced from family to family, searching for permanent place to call home. \n<br /><br />\nAcclimating to these temporary families was impossible, and when Dom was 14 he got into a serious fight with a foster brother. Dom was arrested in the school cafeteria in front of his friends. He was locked up for a few months and became subsumed in the cycle of within America’s ailing juvenile justice system.\n<br /><br />\nDislocated in life, he found a home in music.\n<br /><br />\n“When I was a kid my mom listened to Roy Orbison, and I remember wanting to be him. I was told I couldn’t be him. So later I had this dream that if I could be him someday, I would be somebody, and maybe my mom could see that,” Dom says.\n<br /><br />\nDom’s personal troubles add a caustic irony to the feel good lyrics on Sun Bronzed Greek Gods. “It’s so sexy/ to be living in America” he sings on “Living in America.” On “Burn Bridges,” he explains, “Burn your bridges / make yourself an island / Just forgive ‘em and forget ‘em.”\n<br /><br />\nOn Dom island, music is the cure. It’s the reason to pick up those broken pieces of your life and move on. Dom says forget that baggage, fuck the past, and rock for now.\n<br /><br />\n“I’m gonna live how I want to/ This is okay/ I’ve been living for today.” – Dom.","musicbrainz_id":null},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/15335/sq_90.jpg","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/15335/original.jpg","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/39821.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"95","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"5"}},"main_lineup_position":"4700","twitter_username":"ElectricTouch","setlist":null,"title":"Electric Touch","updated_at":"2011-05-23 16:03:58 -0500","youtube_id":"7cDeeNMlO3I","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/64395.json","title":"MIDNIGHT CONSPIRACY"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/133581.json","title":"The Cars"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/42355.json","title":"Foo Fighters"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/61332.json","title":"Kids These Days"}]},"flickr_tag":"electrictouch","id":"39821","echonest_id":"AR4LDUS11C8A42C2FF","homepage":"http://www.electrictouch.com/","myspace_link":"http://www.myspace.com/electrictouchmusic","fan_count":"299","description":"With members hailing from both sides of the Atlantic this exciting 5-piece delivers a unique brand of British-American Rock music.

Lights is, as the New York Times put it, “a happy car crash of signifiers: part electro-pop, part soul, part blues, part indie rock, part folk” that mixes heartfelt emotion with other-worldly atmospherics. Anchoring her songs with acoustic guitar, Goulding and her producer, Starsmith, spin cool electronica into dreamy warmth on “Starry Eyed,” “Guns and Horses,” “The Writer,” and “Under the Sheets.”\n<br /><br />\n“I’m not afraid of pop or electronic music,” Goulding says of the euphoric, dance-till-you-drop vibe of Lights, “but I also wanted the album to embrace my love for folk music, not just by my playing guitar on it, but by writing about things that have truly affected me. I wear my heart on my sleeve and am aware of how I’m feeling all the time, so it’s impossible for me to write words that are contrived or meaningless.”\n<br /><br />\nGoulding’s lyrics are refreshingly direct as she chronicles the highs and lows of love in her airy, gossamer voice. “Under The Sheets” addresses sleeping around, while “Animal” revels in the feverish state of falling in love. “The Writer” cops to her being paralyzed with obsession over a lover. “I’ve gotten so many messages from girls who can relate to ‘The Writer,’” Goulding says. “I think anyone can get to the point where they love someone so much that they just start doing ridiculous things, like smoking or drinking, or dressing differently, I know I’ve done it.” “Guns and Horses” is about falling in love with someone who doesn’t really know how to love and wanting to take their pain away. The album takes its title from the song “Lights,” which is about Goulding’s fear of the dark. “Having a light on always makes me feel safe,” she says. “It gives me strength, which is why I named the album after that song.”\n<br /><br />\nThen there’s the first U.S. single “Starry Eyed,” which Goulding describes as “one of those rare songs that isn’t melancholy and is actually a bit happier. I kind of throw everything to the wind and say, ‘Who cares about emotions? Let’s just have fun,’” she says with a laugh. “I love sad songs, but I also appreciate feel-good songs.” \n<br /><br />\nA self-taught singer and guitarist, Ellie was raised with her three siblings in Hereford, a cathedral city about 16 miles east of the Welsh border. After her parents divorced when she was five, Goulding moved to the tiny rural village of Lyonshall with her mother and her mother’s new boyfriend, a lorry driver. “I basically went from living in the city to suddenly living in the countryside,” she says. “At first I hated it, but I slowly grew to love it and became completely fascinated by being surrounded by all this wide open space – it still colors everything I do to this day.”\n<br /><br />\nMoney was scarce, so Ellie shared a bedroom with her two sisters. “It wasn’t easy, plus there was the added stress of my dad leaving, but I got along okay,” she says. Her first memory of becoming interested in music is wanting to sing the loudest in her school’s assemblies. “I was pretty quiet, but I really loved to sing and would use my voice at any opportunity,” she says. “We couldn’t afford lessons, so I learned by copying other singers, like Lauryn Hill, Beyonce, and Celine Dion; I loved singers whose voices were really powerful.” Being a performer, however, didn’t seem like a real possibility. “It didn’t feel like something that could ever really happen, coming from my background,” she says. At 15, obsessed with bands like Deftones, Pearl Jam, and Rage Against the Machine, Goulding taught herself to play guitar. “The minute I could master actually strumming and singing at the same time was when I started writing proper songs,” she says. In her teens, Goulding sang one of her own compositions for a family friend, who encouraged her to listen to folk music. She soon became inspired by such artists as Alison Krauss, Fleet Foxes, Joni Mitchell, and Sufjan Stevens.\n<br /><br />\nIt was while studying Politics, English, and Drama at the University Kent in Canterbury, where Goulding first found the confidence to perform onstage after winning a university talent competition. Gigs in London followed and soon Goulding was looking for a producer to help her flesh out her songwriting ideas. She discovered Vincent Frank, a British electro-pop musician and producer who goes by the name Frankmusik, and got in touch with him via MySpace. “He listened to my demos and really loved them, so we started working together and writing more songs,” she says. “I began getting more gigs and that’s when I realized I wanted to drop out of university to focus on music.”\n<br /><br />\nGoulding moved to London and locked herself in her room with a guitar. Songs like “The Writer,” “Starry Eyed,” “Salt Skin,” “This Love,” and “Your Biggest Mistake,” came pouring out. After a friend sent a link to a MySpace page for Fin Dow-Smith, a remixer, composer, and musician who works under the moniker Starsmith, Goulding sent him a demo she’d done, which resulted in a fruitful working relationship that continues to this day. \n<br /><br />\n“Fin understood that it was pop, but a bit more emotional,” Goulding says of Starsmith, who’s known for his remixes of tracks by Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, and Passion Pit, among others. “I liked that he was this really cool DJ with really fresh sounds, but wasn’t afraid of pop music. Working with him was when I started to have faith in my writing and thinking something could actually come of giving music a go.”\n<br /><br />\nThe two began making tracks an album in the summer of 2009, demos of which caught the attention of the major labels in the U.K. Goulding signed with Polydor Records and released her first single “Under the Sheets,” which she later performed, along with “Guns and Horses,” on Later…With Jools Holland, a star-making appearance that won her the attention of both critics and fans. In early 2010, it was announced the Goulding had topped the “BBC Sound of 2010” poll, which surveys critics and broadcasters for their top choices for rising stars in the coming year. She also won the Critics’ Choice Award at the 2010 BRIT Awards (previously won by Adele and Florence & the Machine). In February, “Starry Eyed” was released as a single (climbing to No. 4 on the U.K. Singles chart), followed by the March release of Lights, which shot straight to the top of the U.K. Albums chart. \n<br /><br />\n“I found out that the album was No. 1 while driving through the countryside on my way home from a gig up north,” she says. “I was very emotional and, quietly, very proud. I felt like this was just the beginning.” And it was. More hit singles followed, “The Writer” and a cover of Elton John’s “Your Song,” which climbed to No. 2 after being featured in a Christmas commercial for British retailer John Lewis. Goulding hit the road and sold out three headlining tours in the U.K., and performed at numerous music festivals, including Glastonbury, V Festival, and T in the Park, earning rave reviews for her joyful, no-holds barred live shows. \n<br /><br />\nNominated for two 2011 BRIT Awards (for “British Female Solo Artist” and “British Breakthrough Act”), Goulding is gearing up for the Stateside release of Lights. “I’m really excited to come to America and visit new places and see new countryside,” she says. “I feel ready to introduce my music and see what people think of it there. I’m hoping they’ll like it and be inspired, the way I was when I first heard certain artists. I want to create that excitement you get when you’ve discovered something special and feel happy to have ever come across it in the first place.”","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/ellie-goulding","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Having already conquered her native Britain with the biggest and fastest selling debut album of 2010, Lights-- premiering at No. 1 on the U.K. album chart, four hit singles she co-wrote, and a BRIT award -- singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding is ready to make a similar splash in America with her sparkling electro-folk-pop sound.

Don't let the brevity of that sentence deceive you; it contains universes.\n <br /><br />\nFences is not merely the recording alias of the Seattle songwriter. It is the distillation of Mansfield's entire aesthetic. \"I've tried to take everything in the world that I love, and turn it into this thing that's Fences,\" says the straightforward 27-year-old. Fences starts with Mansfield's life experience to date, and ends… well, when he says so. Hopefully not for a long time. Because right now, Fences is just coming into its own, with the release of a stunning debut album, entitled, naturally, Fences.\n <br /><br />\nThe ten-song set was co-produced by Sara Quin of Tegan & Sara, who Mansfield credits not only with helping him sculpt the most fully realized expression of his music to date, but also giving him impetus to forge ahead before they'd ever collaborated artistically. \"I was just working as a breakfast cook, spending my money at the bar, and playing songs with my friends in my kitchen. It was no big deal. And then when she contacted me, I remember thinking, Whoa! My life might be a little different from now on.\" Not to exaggerate the impact of her interest—this isn't The Blind Side, folks—but encouragement from an established recording artist went a long way towards making Mansfield take his music more seriously.\n <br /><br />\n\"Everything that Chris writes, melodically and lyrically, has that rare balance of patience and urgency that I love in honest, haunting pop songs,\" says Quin. And she did her homework before arriving at that laudatory conclusion. Prior to recording Fences, Quin requested that Mansfield send her everything he'd written to date. From those forty selections, they winnowed the choices down. \"Both of us wanted to capture the most potent Fences, the thing that sums it up as a whole, song-wise—especially since this was a debut.\"\n <br /><br />\nFences is the culmination of Mansfield's songwriting to date, stretching back to the project's inception in the Boston area circa 2004, and continuing right up to songs written shortly before recording. \"Hands,\" carried by hypnotic finger picking and a gauzy vocal performance, is among the oldest selections in Mansfield's catalog, while \"From Russia With…\" and \"Sadie\"—a standout that stakes out the treacherous terrain between emo and Americana with quiet confidence—are newly minted. Longtime fans will find polished renditions of concert favorites \"The Same Tattoos\" and the musical dialogue \"My Girl The Horse,\" the latter's haunting refrain \"neither one of us will make it down this hill alive\" lingering long after the fade. Mansfield jokes that he traffics in \"wussy pop music,\" and his full-band live performances are more upbeat than novices might anticipate, but as Fences attests, beneath his sing-along hooks and charismatic performances are songs with a steel core.\n <br /><br />\nFences summarizes Mansfield's music in succinct, compelling fashion—no simple feat, considering that his sound doesn't fit neatly in any single box. He speaks with audible affection of '80s innovators like the Cure, Kate Bush, and Morrissey, icons who created a consummate, all-encompassing aesthetic, just as he aspires to do with Fences. A close listen to the rhythm tracks on several cuts also underscores Mansfield's love of down-tempo classic country. An anthology of Johnny Cash's Sun Records sides was one of his constant soundtracks while working as a dishwasher. \"The tempo of that material just has a unrelenting drive,\" he reflects. \"It carries the lyrics from start to finish before you even realize what has been said.\"\n <br /><br />\nFurther enriching his sound, Mansfield also has a powerful affinity for jazz, citing John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and Wayne Shorter among his favorites. \"Sometimes that music is just so chaotic, which is what growing up feels like,\" he observes. \"I always wondered why more confused teenagers didn't listen to jazz. The girl you're in love with doesn't love you back? Go home and put on Charlie Parker playing 'Embraceable You.'\" Later he studied at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. Sometimes Mansfield's jazz background is reflected in something as simple as augmenting a minor chord with a major seventh, but Berklee also sold him on the value of commitment and discipline. Hence Mansfield's laser-like focus on achieving his goals. \"I appreciate the workmanship, the dedication required to get the art to where it should be.\"\n <br /><br />\nLike the aforementioned Morrissey, Mansfield's involvement in Fences extends well beyond the music, to the accompanying record sleeves, promotional photos, and videos. The cover of his self-released 2008 Ultimate Puke EP may have seemed better suited to a sludge or speed metal band, with it's well-executed cartoon of a grizzly bear regurgitating a half-digested Fences logo, but Mansfield commissioned that imagery for specific reasons: \"That EP was a mix of all these demos and shit on my computer,\" literally purged from his hard drive. Plus he wanted a sleeve that eschewed the obvious visual vocabulary a comparable artist might've chosen. \"You wouldn't expect that kind of art to accompany this sort of music, you'd expect maybe a cute little bird on the cover.\"\n <br /><br />\nOn the other hand, for the more thoughtful Fences, he chose a personal talisman, a found photograph (of a young girl covered in Christmas tinsel) he'd long used as a bookmark. \"I wanted this album to look slightly mature and beautiful, but you still can't categorize exactly what that might be. If you just saw that art, you wouldn't really know what the music sounds like.\" But you would definitely be intrigued, and your curiosity would be rewarded. Or watch the video for \"Girls With Accents.\" Despite a lyric that has been misconstrued out of context, Mansfield navigates a confusing landscape—labyrinthine houseplants, kitchen chairs stacked to the rafters, and the layered look taken to ridiculous extremes—while feeding his dog, putting away the dishes. In the clip's maelstrom of seeming insanity, he stays centered… just as his music feels rooted on terra firma no matter how unpleasant or odd the circumstances that inspired it, or how noisy the buzz surrounding it continues to grow.\n<br /><br />\nChris Mansfield is Fences.

The recipe for meteoric success? Six killer musicians, five dapper suits, irresistible songs, some serendipity and one vintage organ. \n<br /><br />\nSince their first show at Hollywood’s Hotel Café in December 2008, Fitz and co. have toured with Maroon 5, played to thousands at Colorado’s world famous Red Rocks Amphitheatre, shared the stage New Year’s Eve with Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings, and performed on KCRW’s esteemed show, Morning Becomes Eclectic. All this on the strength of their stellar five-song EP, Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1.\n<br /><br />\nFor some bands, it takes a lifetime to build this success, but few performers deliver an unrestrained blast of soul-clapping, get-down-on-the-floor, moneymaker shakers like Fitz and the Tantrums. Now post-release of their debut full length, Pickin’ Up the Pieces, which has since earned them a 3 ½ star album review in ROLLING STONE, the troupe is poised to get down in dancehalls across the universe. \n<br /><br />\nIt all began when… [cue flashback sounds]\n<br /><br />\n“I got a call from my ex-girlfriend,” Fitz explains, “And she said, ‘My neighbor is moving out in a hurry and has to sell everything. And, he has this organ…”\n<br /><br />\nFitz, the Svengali frontman of the crew, describes the find like the discovery of a compass, or that treasure map in Goonies, which undoubtedly leads to adventure. Not one to say no, Fitz called some piano movers, cashed in some favors, and seven hours later, the organ went from the curb to his living room. That night, Fitz stationed himself in front of that vintage instrument and wrote a blue-eyed soul anthem, “Breaking the Chains of Love.”\n<br /><br />\n“Sometimes, the Music Gods just give it to you,” Fitz says.\n<br /><br />\nThe overflow of inspiration startled Fitz. He’d spent years in L.A.’s music industry, writing music and working in a studio with Beck producer, Mickey Petralia. But at those 88 keys, just seven hours after that organ dropped into his life, Fitz had finally found his voice. \n<br /><br />\n“I’ve always been a singer,” Fitz says, “but with so much music, I felt that I was trying to push a square peg through a round hole. I was being not true to myself, and it never felt right until I wrote that song, and I sang like that. I thought, this feels so real, so natural.”\n<br /><br />\nFitz shared his vision with long-time friend and saxophonist, James King, who immediately connected with the sound. While the electric guitar drives rock, the saxophone takes center stage in soul, and that’s the way Fitz likes it. “We wanted to find a new vocabulary for the genre, I wanted to make a record without any guitars. Could we make a huge sound with out any guitars?”\n<br /><br />\nA huge sound takes a huge studio--Motown had Studio A in Detroit, Philadelphia International had Sigma Studios, Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound was created in Hollywood’s legendary Gold Star Studios-- but when it came time to capture the feeling and the soul of soul, Fitz knew of the perfect studio: his home.  \n<br /><br />\nThere in the living room, he recorded Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1, a burst of effervescent swingers and floor-stompers, infused with the energy of long forgotten songs. The infectious, rolling rhythms of “Breaking the Chains of Love,” immediately turns your head and actually get cemented in your brain, like a good pop song should.\n<br /><br />\nThe sound is familiar, but distinct. That’s what grabbed the attention of Maroon 5’s Adam Levine.  Levine was getting a tattoo in New York when the tattoo artist told him he had to hear this new band he had discovered. After that one encounter, Levine personally invited Fitz and the Tantrums to join their tour.  \n<br /><br />\nLike the EP, Fitz recorded the full-length debut back at home, to bottle the lightning that struck in those first jam sessions. He now delves into more acerbic lyrical territory, going on the offensive against gold diggers on the exceptionally funky “MoneyGrabber,” and even gets political on the piano-banging, handclap-driven call to action, “Dear Mr. President.” \"L.O.V.\" is a jaunt through pop music history embarking with a groovy organ intro, meandering through juicy big band breakdowns and Fitz's svelte croons, then carrying us away with flute outro. It's a funk-filled plea to give love a chance. These powerful songs take the band’s energy up a notch, but like their energized performances, they never loose control. \n<br /><br />\nThose blistering performances are now well-chronicled for adequate ubiquity, Last Call With Carson Daly nailing the money shot for “MoneyGrabber” at the band’s sold out show in November at LA’s El Rey Theatre featuring a sea of a thousand pogoing fans and a handful of F.A.T.T. gems rocked along with blue-eyed soul vet, Daryl Hall on the band’s spot on Live From Daryl’s House. Lest we forget, omnipresent the T-Mobile HTC ad that actually namechecks the band that, for the past several months, is impossible not to see if you’re watching even an hour’s worth of television. Oh, and there are the hot spots on Criminal Minds, Desperate Housewives and a great many more, not to mention a ton of success at radio for the aforementioned runaway “MoneyGrabber,” all with the promise of more to come. \n<br /><br />\nIn their sound and on the stage, Fitz and the Tantrums are nothing but professionals, and never less than classy. Enter the Tantrums, Fitz’s airtight ensemble keeping it real like it’s1969. Funky drummer John Wicks is a Motown B-side aficionado and prolific session player, Jeremy Ruzumna manned the keyboards for Macy Gray, while King and bassist Ethan Phillips backed De La Soul (Phillips has since been replaced by Joseph Karnes). Then there’s Noelle Scaggs, the powerful voice behind Fitz’s croons. Make no mistake, Scaggs is not just there for “doo-wops” and handclaps. She shimmies and flirts, she stokes the crowd and simmers them down, and she has no qualms about keeping Fitz in check. “She is not just a backup singer,” Fitz says, “We have repartee. Onstage, we’re Ike and Tina.”\n<br /><br />\nThere, on the stage, Fitz and the Tantrums are not just a band, they’re an explosion. Scaggs high steps it to the tight-as-hell rhythm section, while Fitz, cooler than cobalt, croons like the aforementioned Mr. Hall for a new generation. It’s obvious that this is no tryst for the band, this is a full-blown, head-over-heels love affair.

He’d spent years in L.A.’s music industry, writing music and working in a studio with Beck producer, Mickey Petralia. But at those 88 keys, just seven hours after that organ dropped into his life, Fitz had finally found his voice. \n<br /><br />\n“I’ve always been a singer,” Fitz says, “but with so much music, I felt that I was trying to push a square peg through a round hole. I was being not true to myself, and it never felt right until I wrote that song, and I sang like that. I thought, this feels so real, so natural.”\n<br /><br />\nFitz shared his vision with long-time friend and saxophonist, James King, who immediately connected with the sound. While the electric guitar drives rock, the saxophone takes center stage in soul, and that’s the way Fitz likes it. “We wanted to find a new vocabulary for the genre, I wanted to make a record without any guitars. Could we make a huge sound with out any guitars?”\n<br /><br />\nA huge sound takes a huge studio--Motown had Studio A in Detroit, Philadelphia International had Sigma Studios, Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound was created in Hollywood’s legendary Gold Star Studios-- but when it came time to capture the feeling and the soul of soul, Fitz knew of the perfect studio: his home.  \n<br /><br />\nThere in the living room, he recorded Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1, a burst of effervescent swingers and floor-stompers, infused with the energy of long forgotten songs. The infectious, rolling rhythms of “Breaking the Chains of Love,” immediately turns your head and actually get cemented in your brain, like a good pop song should.\n<br /><br />\nThe sound is familiar, but distinct. That’s what grabbed the attention of Maroon 5’s Adam Levine.  Levine was getting a tattoo in New York when the tattoo artist told him he had to hear this new band he had discovered. After that one encounter, Levine personally invited Fitz and the Tantrums to join their tour.  \n<br /><br />\nLike the EP, Fitz recorded the full-length debut back at home, to bottle the lightning that struck in those first jam sessions. He now delves into more acerbic lyrical territory, going on the offensive against gold diggers on the exceptionally funky “MoneyGrabber,” and even gets political on the piano-banging, handclap-driven call to action, “Dear Mr. President.” \"L.O.V.\" is a jaunt through pop music history embarking with a groovy organ intro, meandering through juicy big band breakdowns and Fitz's svelte croons, then carrying us away with flute outro. It's a funk-filled plea to give love a chance. These powerful songs take the band’s energy up a notch, but like their energized performances, they never loose control. \n<br /><br />\nThose blistering performances are now well-chronicled for adequate ubiquity, Last Call With Carson Daly nailing the money shot for “MoneyGrabber” at the band’s sold out show in November at LA’s El Rey Theatre featuring a sea of a thousand pogoing fans and a handful of F.A.T.T. gems rocked along with blue-eyed soul vet, Daryl Hall on the band’s spot on Live From Daryl’s House. Lest we forget, omnipresent the T-Mobile HTC ad that actually namechecks the band that, for the past several months, is impossible not to see if you’re watching even an hour’s worth of television. Oh, and there are the hot spots on Criminal Minds, Desperate Housewives and a great many more, not to mention a ton of success at radio for the aforementioned runaway “MoneyGrabber,” all with the promise of more to come. \n<br /><br />\nIn their sound and on the stage, Fitz and the Tantrums are nothing but professionals, and never less than classy. Enter the Tantrums, Fitz’s airtight ensemble keeping it real like it’s1969. Funky drummer John Wicks is a Motown B-side aficionado and prolific session player, Jeremy Ruzumna manned the keyboards for Macy Gray, while King and bassist Ethan Phillips backed De La Soul (Phillips has since been replaced by Joseph Karnes). Then there’s Noelle Scaggs, the powerful voice behind Fitz’s croons. Make no mistake, Scaggs is not just there for “doo-wops” and handclaps. She shimmies and flirts, she stokes the crowd and simmers them down, and she has no qualms about keeping Fitz in check. “She is not just a backup singer,” Fitz says, “We have repartee. Onstage, we’re Ike and Tina.”\n<br /><br />\nThere, on the stage, Fitz and the Tantrums are not just a band, they’re an explosion. Scaggs high steps it to the tight-as-hell rhythm section, while Fitz, cooler than cobalt, croons like the aforementioned Mr. Hall for a new generation. It’s obvious that this is no tryst for the band, this is a full-blown, head-over-heels love affair.

Three years ago, working class America was under the assumption that their nest eggs were secure, their homes were their safest investments and that the economy was on the upswing. Then, with virtually no warning, their lives were upturned, lifelong dreams and plans were dashed, and neighbors began to turn on one another because of political disagreement. It all happened with the Speed of Darkness.\n<br /><br /> \nThe creation of Flogging Molly's new record, Speed of Darkness, was anything but business as usual for the band. “It wasn’t the album we set out to write,” vocalist/guitarist Dave King says. “It became the album we had to write.”   Musically and lyrically, Flogging Molly has never sounded so mature or rousing, nor have the messages of alienation and hope behind their songs ever been so relevant. Speed of Darkness was written over several months when the band would descend into the basement of King’s Detroit home—a home he shares with his wife, Flogging Molly fiddler, Bridget Regan (they maintain dual residences in Ireland and Detroit, where Bridget was born and raised).  As the country struggled to stay afloat, the songs evolved into odes to the working man and battle cries against the elite establishment that so quickly and callously cast him aside.  “I write from my surroundings,” King says. “I wanted people who’ve lost their jobs to know I was paying attention.  We’re singing for them, all of these good people brought to their knees.” Nowhere is this more apparent than on the charging and bluesy track “The Power’s Out.”\n<br /><br />\nWith Speed of Darkness, the band went into unchartered territory.  The album was recorded at Echo Mountain Recording Studio, which is housed in a converted church in Asheville, North Carolina.  The setting underscored a record that continually asks hard questions of faith and suffering, of belief and deliverance. “We liked making music in a building that had been a voice for the community,” King says. “We just wanted to sing a little louder than they had before.” And sing louder they did. Songs like “A Prayer for Me in Silence” and “The Cradle of Humankind” are journeys through hardship and heartache, through besieged homelands and losses that open like chasms. Other tracks like “This Present State of Grace” and “Oliver Boy” are songs of searching, of country and democracy, songs that bear witness to the glory and terror of being human.  Speed of Darkness also marks the debut of Flogging Molly’s own record label Borstal Beat, which they founded after a great run with SideOneDummy, their home for the last decade.  The new chapter in the band’s life also makes perfect sense: they’re more independent than ever, more themselves than ever.  “We’re more serious now and we’re taking risks.  It’s who Flogging Molly is,” King says.\n<br /><br />\nFlogging Molly has never conformed to industry tastes; they’ve always been the outcasts who put their fans before commercial success, and they’ve always put their music before marketability.  The rewards of such independence and integrity are undeniable on Speed of Darkness. You feel it from the first note to the last, the pathos and the passion, the sweeping and rollicking electricity of inspiration. \n<br /><br />\nFounded in Los Angeles in 1997, Flogging Molly has always defied categorization. The infectious originality of their songs is a badge of honor and key to the band’s creativity, their urgency. They infuse punk rock with Celtic instruments—violin, mandolin and the accordion—and they merge blues progressions with grinding guitars and traditional Irish music, the music of King’s youth.  “We're not a traditional band,\" explains Dublin-born King. \"We are influenced by traditional music and inspired by it, but without question we put our own twist on it.\"  Theirs is music of exile and rebellion, of struggle and history and protest. It’s music of a country torn down the middle; a deeply beautiful and wounded country that knows no quit, and Flogging Molly pays homage to that resolve in every note.  \n<br /><br />\nFlogging Molly’s fans have always appreciated the social and political awareness driving the music.  Swagger, the band’s first album, transcended everyone’s expectations in 2000, and the track “The Worst Day Since Yesterday” was included in the film Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Drunken Lullabies was released in 2002 and certified Gold. In 2004, the band released Within a Mile of Home, and in 2008, Flogging Molly put out Float, a deeply stirring and personal album recorded in King’s native Ireland.  No surprise that Float found the band’s widest audience yet.  Through all of this, Flogging Molly—first, last, and always a live band—was touring, playing raucous and adrenaline-fueled shows in bars, pubs, and nearly every major rock festival in North America, Europe, and Japan. “In Ireland,” King says, “you go to the pub to have a conversation.  That’s what we do every night on stage, go to the ‘pub’ and trade stories.” In 2010, to showcase their unparalleled and limitless energy on stage, the band released Flogging Molly: Live at the Greek Theatre, a three disc set chronicling their legendary sold out shows at one of LA’s most famous music venues. \n<br /><br />\nSpeed Of Darkness is music to play after you’ve lost your job or your love, and music to listen to as you dream of better things for your family and country.  It’s the music you hear as you fight a bigger man, and it’s the music you hear as you help him from the floor and buy him a pint at the bar.  The album, like Flogging Molly itself, is a testament to youth and resilience, to growing old and the wisdom of scars, and yet for all of the record’s darkness and the speed with which it descends, the ultimate theme is one of light: We can persevere.  We must and we will persevere. - Bret Anthony Johnston","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/flogging-molly","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"The lights have gone out on many Americans.
