From\nThe Beatles and Rolling Stones to Wham!, Culture Club and Tears For Fears, this\nphenomenon does not seem to skip any generation. In the latest decade, we have seen\nColdplay, Amy Winehouse., and more recently, artists like Taio Cruz and Jay Sean hit the top\nof the charts. It is with this in mind that the undisputed British breakout star of 2010, Tinie\nTempah, has set his sights on America.\n<br /><br />\nTinie Tempah has had an incredible year ‐ few debut artists boast three hit singles, a\nGlastonbury performance on the Pyramid stage and millions of YouTube views. He is\nofficially certified as the best selling British debut act of 2010. Yet this 22 year‐old artist has\ncaptivated music fans, celebrities and critics alike in just a matter of months.\nTinie began the year as a newly signed artist in the melee of other musicians hoping to make\nan impact on the UK music scene. His major label debut single Pass Out hit No.1, and has\nsince had in excess of 11 million views. Its follow‐up, Frisky, shot straight to No.2 and has\nbeen viewed over 8 million times. Combined, both singles have sold upwards of 750,000\ncopies. His third single, Written In The Stars, reached #1 and thus far, he has sold over one\nmillion singles in the UK alone. His debut album, DiscOvery,\ndebuted at #1 in the UK, and\nwent gold in its first week, further proving his star power. Tinie plans to duplicate this\nsuccess streak in the US by introducing himself with his number one UK banger Pass Out\nfollowed by the melodic, and also number one UK single, Written In The Stars.\nWritten In The Stars, produced by Swedish powerhouse Ishi, details the 21 year‐old’s past,\npresent and future ambitions. “I’m trying to live the dream and other people can do the\nsame if they put their mind to it. That’s what the song is about. You can do everything I’ve\ndone, if you’re determined and driven enough.” Featuring the incredible vocals of Boston\nnewcomer Eric Turner, the epic, synth‐led single features crisp drums, razor‐sharp guitars\nand a considered message delivered in Tinie’s uniquely credible style. “I used to be the kid\nthat noone\ncared about, that’s why you have to keep screaming till they hear you out,” raps\nTinie.\n<br /><br />\nWhile the first singles sound like bonafide radio smashes, they are just a taste of what’s to\ncome on Tinie’s debut album, Disc‐Overy, set for release in May 2011. As well as\nhighlighting the finer things in life that success can offer, Tinie details the lows of fame and\nfortune, as well as offering a candid insight into his childhood growing up in south London.\n“On every single song you’ll get a line that reveals what life was, and is, like for me. I\nrecorded a lot of it after Pass Out went to No.1, so that gave me a chance to reflect on life\nbefore and after achieving success. When I’m in the studio, it’s just me in my tracksuit, a\nbottle of water and my thoughts. Going to No.1 gave me a chance to consider how far I’ve\ncome, but also how far I intend to go.”\n<br /><br />\nAn incredibly confident debut, DiscOvery\ncertifies Tinie's absolute ability to achieve\nworldwide success. With Tinie already on the US radar thanks to remixes with Diddy and\nSnoop, DiscOvery\nreasserts his global appeal by offering inventive production and a range\nof rhymes that are in turn frank and funny. The diverse and imaginative album features\ncollaborations with Ellie Goulding and Kelly Rowland and production from Labrinth\n(Pass Out, Frisky), newcomer Ishi, Al Shux (Jay‐Z’s Empire State Of Mind) and Naughty Boy\n(Chipmunk, Wiley), as well as renowned dance producers Swedish House Mafia.\n<br /><br />\nThe song Simply Unstoppable underscores Tinie’s roots while Swedish House Mafia have\ncreated an undeniable dancefloor anthem in the form of Miami 2 Ibiza, and Naughty Boy\ndelivers a deliciously brooding pop number Let Go, featuring Emile Sande. One of Tinie’s\npersonal favourites, the laidback Snap talks about chronicling life photographically,\nincluding “My mom and dad’s wedding picture, which is my favourite photo in the world”,\nwhile Wonderman features Ellie Goulding and is produced by Labrinth. “I wanted this\nalbum to be really raw, not only in terms of the production but the guests. I was only\ninterested in working with people I really respect and who I’m a fan of. I met Ellie very early\non, we swapped numbers and after that we started living very parallel worlds; the same\nfestivals, interviews and so on. It made total sense to have her on the album.”\n<br /><br />\nHe may be distinctive in his delivery and creative in his approach to the business of music,\nyet the charismatic rapper’s own background is much like an average kid anywhere in the\nworld. “I’ve never tried to be anything than what I am. I was well bought up, I liked school, I\nliked learning, I’m well educated, I’m well spoken,” Tinie reflects. His mom and dad were\nkeen to keep their kids away from trouble, moving the family from Peckham to Plumstead\nwhen Tinie was 11. It's thanks to his capital city upbringing that Tinie has been able to\nachieve all he has. \"London is one of the only places in the world where you can live in a\ncouncil block and see a beautiful semi‐detached house across the street. Growing up around\nthat was inspirational, it kept me motivated.\" Yet, despite success on the underground, few\nwould have predicted just how hugely successful he would become.\n<br /><br />\nSince signing, he has accomplished more than anyone might have imagined ‐ yet for this\ndriven young man, it’s clearly just the beginning of an already incredible career. With a\nlong‐term goal in mind, Tinie is far from a one‐hit wonder. This pragmatic, prudent MC is\nmindful of the decisions he makes, and has big plans for himself.\n<br /><br />\n“I really want people to get this album, I want them to listen to it as a whole and see that not\nall the tracks are chart‐driven. I really wanted to give people some ‘Tinie Time’ for an hour,”\nhe insists. “I want people to see this is not a joke to me; now I’m here and I’ve been given the\nopportunity, I’m not messing around. I’m looking to take my tour, the videos, the music,\neverything, completely beyond what you can fathom. It’s never just another day in the life of\nTinie; I’ve got a lot to do and you can bet on the fact that I’ll do it.”","hometown":"London, UK","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/tinie-tempah","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"For decades, US music charts have seen what they call a “British Invasion” take place.

The band’s leader, Patrick Stickles – introduced the album at that time with a letter to the media. It is below, in its original glory. \n<br /><br />\nYou should know however, that since its release, it’s been heralded as one of 2010s top albums, and the critics fell immediately in love with it. \n<br /><br />\nDear distinguished members of the press, \n<br /><br />\nThe New Jersey indie rock band Titus Andronicus has recorded a new album, a follow-up to our 2008 (2009?) release, The Airing of Grievances. This new album, The Monitor, will see release thanks to our friends at XL Recordings on March 9th, 2010, the 148th anniversary of the Battle of Hampton Roads, wherein the U.S.S. Monitor and the C.S.S. Virginia entered into their epic struggle off the coast of Virginia. \nThe Monitor is more or less a “concept album” – that is to say, it uses the American Civil War of 1861-1865 as an extended metaphor for the concerns addressed in a somewhat linear narrative. In said narrative, our hero leaves his humble birthplace of New Jersey – the oppressive and stifling qualities of which were discussed ad nauseam about one album ago – for the greener pastures of Boston, Massachusetts. His thesis – “the enemy is everywhere” – is put to the ultimate test as he pontificates on the topics of regional identity, emotional anesthetization, and the heavy yoke of trying to live decently in indecent times. All the while, he is forced to wonder whether said American Civil War was truly won or lost, or even completed. Will he find the supportive environment and like-minded compatriots he dreams of? Or will he be forced to leave his newly adopted home in ideological disgrace? What does it mean to be an American in 2009 anyway? Who are our so-called “friends” and how actually friendly are they? Is it necessary, or even a good idea, for an indie rock album to ask these sorts of questions? The Dark Knight, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and The Taming of the Shrew also fit in there somewhere.\n<br /><br />\nThe Monitor was recorded during August of 2009, under the watchful eye of producer and engineer Kevin McMahon (who oversaw our first album, among others), at his studio – Marcata Recording – in New Paltz, NY. The usual suspects from the world of Titus Andronicus were all in attendance, as well as an all-star cast of luminous friends (members of Ponytail, Wye Oak, Vivian Girls, Hold Steady, etc.) and a generous assortment of colorful New Paltz locals. The aforementioned Kevin McMahon also did the mixing during September and October, and Greg Calbi did the mastering (so chosen because he is the only person alive who can claim involvement in both The Chemistry of Common Life by Fucked Up and Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell by Meat Loaf) in early November. \n<br /><br />\nSo what does all this sound like? It has long passages of ambient drones, blazing saxophone, pianos homages to “A Charlie Brown Christmas,” complete marching drumlines, Thunder Tube solos, fourteen-minute Billy Bragg knock-offs, backwards liturgical pieces, bombastic country duets, garbage cans hit with tambourines, choirs of angels with bromantic faces, probably too many spoken word interludes lifted from cassette tapes, and, of course, the hissy-fit punk songs and off-key warbling we have come to expect from Titus Andronicus. Did I mention that this record is sixty-five minutes long? Because that’s kind of important. Through and through, it is a wholehearted and potentially ill-advised grab for some sort of imaginary brass ring, the sound of a band desperate for success and defiantly unafraid of failure. That was the idea, at least. \n<br /><br />\nBlah blah blah Springsteen blah blah blah beer blah blah blah beard blah blah blah Shakespeare yadda yadda yadda Seinfeild blah blah blah Conor Oberst in a vat of acid blah blah blah books. \nThe Monitor will be available as a compact disc or as a double vinyl LP, both with gorgeous artwork by Nolen Strals, vocalist of Double Dagger and co-author of the recently published textbook, Lettering and Type, or in regular old MP3 format, featuring no gorgeous artwork at all. The tracklisting and cover can be found below, along with a video trailer created by official Titus Andronicus documentarian and the mastermind behind “Titus TV,” Alex Tretiak, MLS, which will hopefully stoke the fires of yr anticipation. \n<br /><br />\nIt is our dearest hope that you will find favor in our latest effort, and that the next year will find us the toast of the indie rock world. If not, well, that is okay, too, for we punks believe that the tree falling in the forest does make a noise, and of all those unheralded falling trees, we want to be the loudest. Hear us, or don’t, at yr discretion and/or own peril. \n<br /><br />\nYr friend,<br /> \nPatrick","hometown":"GLEN ROCK, NEW JERSEY","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/titus-andronicus","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"In March of this year, XL Recordings released Titus Andronicus’ epic second album THE MONITOR.

Rooted in rock and pop, with elements of electronica / electro, and Afro-beats, the sum is greater than any ‘indie electro pop’ parts. \n<br /><br />\nTwo Door Cinema Club’s story begins four years ago in a town just outside of Belfast, Northern Ireland. Vocalist/guitarist Alex Trimble and bassist Kevin Baird studied music together; guitarist Sam Halliday was a friend of Alex’s. \n<br /><br />\nBy this point, the boys’ tastes had gravitated toward alt/indie-rock, such as Bloc Party, Architecture In Helsinki, Death Cab For Cutie and Modest Mouse, whose collectively leaner, rhythmic and melodic approach spilled over into their own music. Two Door Cinema Club inked a deal in North and South America with Glassnote Records and recently released their debut album, Tourist History.\n<br /><br />\nRecorded in London at Eastcote Studios and produced by Elliott James (Bloc Party, Noah And The Whale) with a number of tracks mixed by Phillipe Zdar (Phoenix, Justice, Cassius), the album simply multiplies the single’s surfeit of ideas and sounds. The opening track, “Cigarettes In The Theatre,” perfectly displays the bands light-footed yet hard-driving energy, highlighted by Alex’s vocal melody, with its almost dreamy brand of urgency. It’s followed by “Come Back Home,” a sequel of sorts; introducing a bed of woozy synths that build and act as a launching pad for a digi-funk backdrop that bounces, swings and rocks behind Alex’s confessions of relationships-past. The album, he explains, has two general themes – ‘love’ songs (“but not in a typical sense; I’m adamant about avoiding clichés”) and songs that “chart our progression over these past 18 months. Where we’ve come from to where we are now with this album.” \n<br /><br />\nPrior to recording their album, the young trio was faced with choosing between the security of university and a potential career, and the uncertainty and thrill of the band. “Undercover Martyn,” “What You Know,” “I Can Talk,” and “You’re Not Stubborn” address that issue, and are loosely linked by the theme of arguments and justifying what you believe in. “Something Good Can Work” is a song-title that explains and justifies the band’s success, while Alex says “Do You Want It All?” is“a song of hope, to keep us going, with the thought that if we try hard enough, we’re gonna do well.” \n<br /><br />\nWhen released in the US, Tourist History immediately shot up the iTunes chart to number 30 on the overall album chart and maintained the number 7 spot on the alternative chart. Tourist History also made an impressive Top 10 debut on Billboard’s Heatseekers Album Chart. An immediate fan favorite, the album was included in many “Best of 2010” lists including the number 1 spot on the NYLON Magazine Top 20 of 2010, where they state, “It is impossible to listen to Tourist History just once. It is practically impossible to listen to it just once a day. We should know!”","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/two-door-cinema-club","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Northern Ireland’s TWO DOOR CINEMA CLUB is a music-mad trio whose debut album fizzes with invention and sparkling tunes.

It’s followed by “Come Back Home,” a sequel of sorts; introducing a bed of woozy synths that build and act as a launching pad for a digi-funk backdrop that bounces, swings and rocks behind Alex’s confessions of relationships-past. The album, he explains, has two general themes – ‘love’ songs (“but not in a typical sense; I’m adamant about avoiding clichés”) and songs that “chart our progression over these past 18 months. Where we’ve come from to where we are now with this album.” \n<br /><br />\nPrior to recording their album, the young trio was faced with choosing between the security of university and a potential career, and the uncertainty and thrill of the band. “Undercover Martyn,” “What You Know,” “I Can Talk,” and “You’re Not Stubborn” address that issue, and are loosely linked by the theme of arguments and justifying what you believe in. “Something Good Can Work” is a song-title that explains and justifies the band’s success, while Alex says “Do You Want It All?” is“a song of hope, to keep us going, with the thought that if we try hard enough, we’re gonna do well.” \n<br /><br />\nWhen released in the US, Tourist History immediately shot up the iTunes chart to number 30 on the overall album chart and maintained the number 7 spot on the alternative chart. Tourist History also made an impressive Top 10 debut on Billboard’s Heatseekers Album Chart. An immediate fan favorite, the album was included in many “Best of 2010” lists including the number 1 spot on the NYLON Magazine Top 20 of 2010, where they state, “It is impossible to listen to Tourist History just once. It is practically impossible to listen to it just once a day. We should know!”","musicbrainz_id":null},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14974/sq_90.jpg","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14974/original.jpg","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/107180.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"94","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"5"}},"main_lineup_position":"4650","twitter_username":"weareTYPHOON","setlist":null,"title":"Typhoon","updated_at":"2011-05-16 12:39:10 -0500","youtube_id":"-chcOC4ejEI","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/52399.json","title":"Ruby Jane"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/37852.json","title":"Bright Eyes"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/40966.json","title":"Wye Oak"}]},"flickr_tag":"typhoon","id":"107180","echonest_id":"ARO4DKQ1187B999536","homepage":"http://www.wearetyphoon.com","myspace_link":"http://www.myspace.com/wearetyphoon","fan_count":"247","description":"Dear Reader,\n<br /><br />\nI once came very close to dying (bug-bite, failed organs), and though my life was spared thanks to thanks to modern medicine and a kidney given to me by my father, nonetheless I live with a persisting sense that my time is borrowed.

That was a huge moment for me. This is what real bands do: play to an international audience, millions of people, with one of the most famous men in the world. Being part of that was incredible. We were like little kids, running about the studio, sitting in his chair. Probably the most ‘big-time’ thing we got to do.”\n<br /><br />\nCharles Cave, bass player, got his moment of thrilling validation by the side of a Polish motorway. “We’d never played Poland before, and our bus broke down four hours from a festival we were booked at. We sat there for ten hours. They sent cars out to get us. And we were thinking, we’ve got a 9pm slot in a tent in a country we’ve never played before. Is this all worth it? What are we stressing out for? But we got there, got changed, and walked on stage to probably the most insane crowd we’ve ever had. There must have been 20,000 people crammed into this tent. And when the first song started, it was obvious everyone knew every single word.”\n<br /><br />\n“I felt a bit sick to be honest,” admits the band’s loquacious, thoughtful lyricist. “I’ve never felt quite so emotionally battered by a gig. And now Poland is one of our best places to go. And that show represents the hard work that we put in outside of the UK. A lot of bands that I suppose are our rivals, or our contemporaries, are doing a lot better than us statistically in the UK. But we have a fanbase around the world, places like Poland, Russia, Japan, Mexico…”\n<br /><br />\n“The two nights at Brixton Academy were very special,” says Harry McVeigh, singer with the three-piece who formed in west London in 2006. “Kind of homecoming shows, but it just felt amazing to be in a venue we’d all grown up going to. And to bring in a huge production – we felt like a professional band,” he adds. “Suddenly it was this ‘huge’ thing.”\n<br /><br />\nA huge thing indeed. To Lose My Life entered the UK charts at number one when released in January 2009 and went on to sell well over 750,000 copies around the world. New band of the year gongs at both the Q and Mojo awards alongside NME cover features and a coveted number 2 slot in the NME readers album of the year poll confirmed that 2009 had been some year for White Lies.\n<br /><br />\nAnd so to late 2010. Recharged, excited and buoyed by a new-found self-belief, White Lies have taken the experiences they gleaned traveling the world and alchemised them into Ritual, their full-blooded, big-booted tech-rock second album.\n<br /><br />\nThe trio’s confidence, gung-ho vigour and ambition are on display in the moody, classically-framed electronica of Peace And Quiet, Lawrence-Brown’s favourite track. “It means a lot to me. It was the last one we did in the studio, so there was quite a lot of closure involved. But, for me, it’s the high point of the record. It felt different recording it - freer, much looser. It has the most organic feel, even though it has electronic drums at the start and end.”\n<br /><br />\nAnd then there’s the band’s choice of Alan Moulder as producer. Alongside Max Dingel, who worked on To Lose My Life, the legendary man behind classic records by everyone from Them Crooked Vultures back to My Bloody Valentine, helped the band shape their ideas in his Assault And Battery studios in northwest London. “Alan’s the man we needed,” says Cave. “He’s older, wiser, a technical genius, and without a doubt he helped us realise everything we wanted to do but didn’t quite know how to get there.”\n<br /><br />\nAnd those qualities are the foundation of Ritual – a record that was written in five quick-smart weeks and recorded in six. No messing around, no faffing or flailing in search of a “new direction” or “sure-hit singles”. Just a band of teenage friends, evolving into a tight, focused, imaginative, mutually supportive three-way unit.\n<br /><br />\n“Initially we did have grand plans – we visited this really nice studio in Paris,” recalls Cave. “But this was three weeks into the writing process, and things were really going well. Two weeks later we were done. The vast difference in the writing this time was that Harry and I wrote it on his computer at home. Whereas last time we wrote it on a keyboard then translated it instantly into a three-piece set-up, recorded that, then added some more bits afterwards.”\n<br /><br />\nBut not that many bits – many elements of the demos for the songs on Ritual have survived. That’s how emboldened White Lies were. A development, they admit, that comes in part from the fact that their record collections have expanded “twenty-fold” since they made their first album.\n<br /><br />\n“Touring we’d built a huge bank of influences, songs and artists that we really liked,” says McVeigh. “For the first time in our lives we had a bit of money and the first thing we did was spent it on a load of music. That had a big impact – we were soaking all this new music up.\n<br /><br />\nTheir new listening habits – Richie Hawtin, in his Plastikman guise and other nommes de bleep; Swedish metal band Opeth; Danish producer Trentemøller – directly informed the techno throb of The Power & The Glory. “The glitchy sounding electronic percussion in that song is a direct homage to those things,” says Cave.\n<br /><br />\nThe first single is the towering, glowering, thumping Bigger Than Us.\n<br /><br />\n“It has quite a big chorus,” grins McVeigh. “It’s a good song for radio. I know it sounds like we think about which songs will do well, but I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. We’re a very ambitious band. We want the best for our record.”\n<br /><br />\nThe closing Come Down is another pivotal song. McVeigh’s voice, rich and resonant, floats over a minimal electronic beat-scape, both icy and warm, before… going somewhere else entirely.\n<br /><br />\n“We started off wanting that to be like a stripped down Tears For Fears,” smiles Cave. “Within ten minutes that idea had gone. The middle section which is full-on gospel and very R&B – well, we sat listening to it, smiling to each other, but going: I dunno, is this cool, is this any good? But we’re really proud of that moment. We like the fact that some people are gonna go, what the fuck is this?”\n<br /><br />\nThe album title, the lyricist adds, derives from the fact that “a lot of the songs deal with various rituals: daily rites of passage, things that all humans do which aren’t necessarily good for them. So a song like Holy Ghost is very literal, making observations on really extreme examples of fundamental religion. Whereas Strangers looks at the ritual of having a very unemotional, physical relationship with someone.\n<br /><br />\n“And in a way the album links all these different things and draws them all to the same conclusion. Is doing this really just a way of killing time or trying to find some purpose in life? And is someone who gets up every morning and prays for three hours any different in the way that they view their life compared to someone who sleeps with a different person or drinks themselves silly every night?”\n<br /><br />\nAdds McVeigh, “I like the title because it means everything but nothing all at the same time. It can refer to religion or love as the most important things in your life. Or it can refer to how every night you get back from work and watch TV, and that’s your ritual.”\n<br /><br />\nAnd for their next highlights… Live, last time round, White Lies expanded to a four-piece. This time they will be five. “More space, more power, more back-up,” nods Jack Brown.\n<br /><br />\n“I think we’ve just changed the intent. With the first record, while we might have denied it at the time, we were very much trying to be bombastic,” says Charles Cave with the brilliant, fierce honesty that informs everything White Lies do. “Quite overly dramatic. We were desperate to have a full string section! We wanted to be as big sounding as possible. I know that’s a loose, dangerous word that’s always thrown about by bands. But we did want that – and we possibly went a little too far.”\n<br /><br />\n“And we received a bit of criticism for sounding a little sterile at some points, or un-genuine. But we’ve fixed that – for one, the lyrics on the first album concerned fictional stories, albeit influenced by real people and events. That always makes it quite hard to get emotionally involved. But this time we’ve been much more ambitious, but in a quite unconventional way. We wanted to see how many cracks we could leave in the final thing. There are less than perfect performances in there. Harry’s voice has been worked like a horse over the last two years, and after 18 months of touring and smoking and drinking, it’s not the young, angelic, clear voice it was before. Which for me is absolutely perfect.”\n<br /><br />\nPower, glory, peace, quiet, sex, religion, mistakes, passion, cracks, heart, soul – Ritual offers all these. And sometimes more. And sometimes less.","hometown":"London, UK","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/white-lies","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Ask White Lies for their personal highlights of the 18-month world tour they undertook in support of 2009’s To Lose My LIfe and the answers come suitably fast, impassioned and diverse.\n<br /><br />\nFor drummer Jack Lawrence-Brown, he was reminded of his special memory a couple of months ago. “I found a t-shirt that we all got given when we went on the David Letterman show in New York.

The middle section which is full-on gospel and very R&B – well, we sat listening to it, smiling to each other, but going: I dunno, is this cool, is this any good? But we’re really proud of that moment. We like the fact that some people are gonna go, what the fuck is this?”\n<br /><br />\nThe album title, the lyricist adds, derives from the fact that “a lot of the songs deal with various rituals: daily rites of passage, things that all humans do which aren’t necessarily good for them. So a song like Holy Ghost is very literal, making observations on really extreme examples of fundamental religion. Whereas Strangers looks at the ritual of having a very unemotional, physical relationship with someone.\n<br /><br />\n“And in a way the album links all these different things and draws them all to the same conclusion. Is doing this really just a way of killing time or trying to find some purpose in life? And is someone who gets up every morning and prays for three hours any different in the way that they view their life compared to someone who sleeps with a different person or drinks themselves silly every night?”\n<br /><br />\nAdds McVeigh, “I like the title because it means everything but nothing all at the same time. It can refer to religion or love as the most important things in your life. Or it can refer to how every night you get back from work and watch TV, and that’s your ritual.”\n<br /><br />\nAnd for their next highlights… Live, last time round, White Lies expanded to a four-piece. This time they will be five. “More space, more power, more back-up,” nods Jack Brown.\n<br /><br />\n“I think we’ve just changed the intent. With the first record, while we might have denied it at the time, we were very much trying to be bombastic,” says Charles Cave with the brilliant, fierce honesty that informs everything White Lies do. “Quite overly dramatic. We were desperate to have a full string section! We wanted to be as big sounding as possible. I know that’s a loose, dangerous word that’s always thrown about by bands. But we did want that – and we possibly went a little too far.”\n<br /><br />\n“And we received a bit of criticism for sounding a little sterile at some points, or un-genuine. But we’ve fixed that – for one, the lyrics on the first album concerned fictional stories, albeit influenced by real people and events. That always makes it quite hard to get emotionally involved. But this time we’ve been much more ambitious, but in a quite unconventional way. We wanted to see how many cracks we could leave in the final thing. There are less than perfect performances in there. Harry’s voice has been worked like a horse over the last two years, and after 18 months of touring and smoking and drinking, it’s not the young, angelic, clear voice it was before. Which for me is absolutely perfect.”\n<br /><br />\nPower, glory, peace, quiet, sex, religion, mistakes, passion, cracks, heart, soul – Ritual offers all these. And sometimes more. And sometimes less.","musicbrainz_id":null},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14954/sq_90.jpg","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14954/original.jpg","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/40966.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"73","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"5"}},"main_lineup_position":"3600","twitter_username":"wyeoak","setlist":null,"title":"Wye Oak","updated_at":"2011-05-05 19:44:58 -0500","youtube_id":"AbOLPRBFjEE","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/107180.json","title":"Typhoon"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/93924.json","title":"Lia Ices"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/82069.json","title":"Tennis"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/52924.json","title":"Smith Westerns"}]},"flickr_tag":"wyeoak","id":"40966","echonest_id":"ARCIX281187B99738F","homepage":"http://www.wyeoakmusic.com/","myspace_link":"http://www.myspace.com/wyeoak","fan_count":"749","description":"On March 8, Merge will release Wye Oak’s third album, Civilian on CD, LP and digital download.

So when she began thinking about recording an album in English she was confronted with a tough decision: “Either stay in my country, where everyone knows who I am, or start from scratch and convince people that I’m worth it.”  She chose the latter.\n<br /><br />\nThe result is a collection of songs that showcase her deep, striking voice, smart, thoughtful lyrics and offbeat personality. “I think of albums as Polaroid pictures of who I was at that given moment,” says Sariñana. “All the songs are a bit dark. They capture a sort of general doom that I try to compensate with humor,” she says. The lead single, “Different,” opens with a playful whistle but is really an apology to listeners “about maybe not expressing myself clearly because of my different nationality,” while “Bringing Us Down” was inspired by the poem “Candles” by Greek poet Constantine P. Cavafy and deals with growing older and looking back at the fading past.  The album not only reflects Sariñana’s wise-beyond-her years demeanor, but also the kind of sonic growth and experimentation expected from a risk-taker. \n<br /><br />\n“Everything was about forcing myself out of my comfort zone,” says the singer, having leapt beyond her usual stripped down, mellow arrangements and into more daring musical territory. “I wanted quicker, bigger sounding songs and more bass and electronic instruments,” says Sariñana, who plays the piano throughout. “I needed to be able to move to it on stage.”\n<br /><br />\nTo help accomplish this, she enlisted producers Greg Kurstin (Lily Allen, Devo, The Bird and the Bee), Dave Sitek (TV on the Radio, Yeah Yeah Yeahs) and Natalia Lafourcade.  Recorded in Los Angeles, the songs are indeed snapshots; vignettes of events and emotions ornamented by lush arrangements and lightened by occasional whimsy.  “Common Ground” is exalted with bells and space drums and “Wrong Miracle” includes circuit-bent children’s toys and footsteps on gravel.  “Echo Park,” one of the last songs recorded, was built around a Casio drum machine and the need for a little comic relief. “I wanted to write something that was going to make me laugh. I didn’t want to go too deep or serious like I usually do,” says Sariñana. “I decided to make fun of how girls, especially in my world, always fall for guys in a band.”   \n<br /><br />\n“Tu Y Yo” (You and Me) is the only song on the album sung entirely in Spanish. “My mother language and the country where I live in is such an important part of who I am,” says Sariñana, who was born in Guadalajara and raised partly in LA before moving to Mexico City. \n<br /><br />\nRaised in a highly creative family—her mother is a screenwriter and her father is a film director and producer—instilled a love of the arts in her early on. “I was four years old when I started acting,” says Sariñana, a natural-born entertainer who became a household name in Mexico by appearing in 11 films (among them box office hit Amar Te Duele and film festival winner Dos Abrazos) as well as three prime time telenovelas. \n<br /><br />\nAn early discovery of jazz greats like Ella Fitzgerald ignited her love of music, and at age 15 she began studying at Mexico’s Academia de Musica Fermatta. At 17, she honed her vocal skills during a five-week program at Boston’s renowned Berklee College of Music and then began fronting a jazz-funk fusion band called Feliz No Cumpleaños (Happy Un-Birthday), which “made a bit of noise in the underground,” as she puts it.  She also brought together her loves of film and music on occasion, co-writing and singing three songs on the Amar Te Duele soundtrack (which stayed on the Top 10 Soundtracks list in Mexico for 10 years) and acting as music supervisor for several films.\n<br /><br />\nBy the time Mediocre was released, Ximena’s status as a artist was already cemented;  the record debuted at number one in Mexico and went platinum soon after.  Mediocre reached #10 on the Billboard Latin Pop Chart, #38 on the Billboard Latin Album Chart and Ximena was the only Latin artist in Itunes Best 10 Albums of 2008.  She won the Best New Artist Award in the Premios MTV Latinoamerica 2008 (Latin MTV Awards) and received three Latin Grammy Nominations for Best New Artist, Best Alternative Song and Producer of the Year.  Mediocre also received a Grammy nomination for Best Latin Rock or Alternative Album.\n<br /><br />\nDespite her successes, Sariñana has no expectations when it comes to her English-language debut. “It’s my first record to a lot of people. I just hope listeners can hear the honesty in the album,” she says. “I titled it after myself because my name keeps it close to me and who I am as an artist and a person.” It’s a name many will come to recognize soon enough.
