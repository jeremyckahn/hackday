If you’re lucky, they might be a true friend; someone you spend\nmore time talking with than you do with your family, maybe even your partner. Imagine if the two of you had the chance\nto leave your jobs behind and go on a crazy, incredibly fun, sometimes stressful but ultimately mind-blowing two-and-ahalf-\nyear musical adventure across continents and time zones, racking up accolades from the likes of Rolling Stone,\nSpin, People and Pitchfork.\n<br /><br />\nTo the Australian indie-rock duo of Kate Cooper (singer/guitarist) and Damon Cox (drummer/singer), An Horse — who\nwent from rehearsing after hours in a Brisbane record store to playing “Camp Out,” the single from their 2009 debut,\nRearrange Beds, on Late Show With David Letterman — making their second album, Walls, isn’t just a chance to set\nthe agenda for their next phase. It’s also an opportunity to reflect on the fantastical journey that has carried them here, a\npipe dream made thrillingly real.\n<br /><br />\n“We'd worked in the record store together for a couple of years and talked every day — even on days off — mostly\nabout music and film, which we continue to do every day now.” says Damon. “After listening to music all day together at\nwork for two years, we had a really clear idea of what we liked and disliked musically.” That bond was the backbone of\nRearrange Beds; after two years of relentless touring, though, including stints out on the road with Tegan & Sara, Death\nCab For Cutie, Cage the Elephant, Silversun Pickups and The Big Pink, An Horse had become a different animal\naltogether.\n<br /><br />\nCooper, like Cox, is frank in her assessment of their earlier album. “With Rearrange Beds, we made a record of two\npeople learning how to play together. I don't think you can hear that on the album per se, but that's what it was.” This\ntime, the pair decided to make a record that reflected their bond not just as music aficionados, but as musical\ncollaborators. “Walls was really deliberate,” Kate explains. “We had hundreds of shows under our belt and we had\nfigured out how to play off each other.”\n<br /><br />\nRegrouping in Vancouver after recharging their batteries in their respective homes — Cooper in Montreal, Cox in\nMelbourne — An Horse brought in Howard Redekopp (who has lent his sonic wizardry to The New Pornographers and\nTegan and Sara as well as An Horse — Redekopp mixed Rearrange Beds) to produce the album. Now the duo would\nfigure out how to play off the studio, too.\n<br /><br />\n“We had many lengthy discussions with Howard before we arrived in Vancouver to record,” says Damon, “and did five\ndays of pre-production — pulling the songs apart, putting them back together, throwing some songs away and even\ncreating new ones — which is something we'd never had the luxury of doing.”\n<br /><br />\nThe atmosphere was comfortable and creative, which was just what they needed. “During the recording, Howard\nbrought his old dog Fanny into the studio,” Kate explains with a wry chuckle. “One day I was getting up in Fanny's face\nwhile Damon was recording with a video camera. I was talking to her, telling her she was such a lovely dog, but Howard\nquickly intervened when he found us. He told us that Fanny had personal space issues and, had I gotten any closer,\nFanny would have had my nose! A few weeks earlier, Fanny had bitten our assistant engineer Jaret's face and he had\nto be rushed to the hospital with Fanny sitting beside him in the car.”\n<br /><br />\nWalls has plenty of the whip-smart, energetic rock that propelled An Horse half-way across the world. The album’s\nopening track, “Dressed Sharply,” is as fizzy and explosive as a shook-up bottle of champagne, spraying the listener\nwith showers of melody and noise. It’s no surprise that the tune is a fan favorite already, thanks to having been\npreviewed in their recent shows. But on the song that follows it, “Not Mine,” the craft and care that went into Walls’\nmaking becomes even clearer. Kate and Damon’s passionate vocals, weave into a pattern with Kate’s chiming guitar,\nbuilding the intensity slowly and deliberately as Damon’s drums nudge the momentum along.\n<br /><br />\nIt’s a powerful tension, one that marks the separation between Rearrange Beds and Walls, where the duo frequently\nreturn to that place where anything can shrink into a whisper or explode into a howl. “They’re my favorite songs on the\nrecord; songs like ‘100 Whales,’ where the mood fits in the middle. We wanted to make a record that sounded way\nbigger and more powerful, but not so big and crazy that it didn't sound like two people,” Damon says.\n<br /><br />\nThe result is a towering sound that doesn’t buckle when it gets quiet, or for that matter, serious. Walls’ songs span a\nwide spectrum of emotions, which came to the surface after Kate had moved to Montreal. “I was really stoked because I\nhad met a girl and was having a good time, but there were also a lot of really terrible things that had happened.”\nMore specifically, the lyrics deal with the wrenching angst of being stuck on tour while a family member falls ill. Plenty of\nsongwriters have observed the monotony of endless hours logged on the interstate, but when your mom phones you to\ntell you that she has to have major surgery and you can’t run to her side all the way in Australia, suddenly you’ve got\nbigger problems than the lack of roadside scenery between Buffalo and Pittsburgh.\n<br /><br />\n“No one in my family told me about my mom’s condition because they didn’t want me to come home,” Kate explains.\n“They said, ‘we didn’t want to worry you.’ So eventually I had this conversation with my mum where she said, ‘Alright,\nwell, I’m gonna go in now and get this done,’ and I was, like, ‘Alright, bye…’ it was crazy. I was struck with this sense\nthat I would have to spend as much time with everyone I care about now because they could die, but I’m going to be on\ntour, so I can’t.”\n<br /><br />\nThere’s a disarming intimacy in Kate’s lyrics, whether she’s relating the experience of waiting for her mom’s results in\n“Brain on a Table,” or the less dramatic but vividly observed “Windows in the City,” where she describes games people\nmake up on the phone when things like geography or work come between them. Both a sense of playfulness and\nfeelings of longing are never far from the surface.\n<br /><br />\nKate: “I think most of the songs for Walls were written in December 2009 to January 2010, when I was in Montreal. I\nwas discovering a new city but I was missing everyone back home. And I was definitely getting frustrated with feeling\nlost.\n<br /><br />\n“When it’s minus 30 degrees out and my girlfriend’s working and my friends are away, and it’s like, what do I do in this\napartment? I just wrote songs. Which was cool, I was really productive.\n<br /><br />\n”In the apartment, there was a bird that wouldn’t shut up. His name was Uncle Pete and his painful ‘cheep cheep’ is all\nover the demos. I had to send them to Damon with notes like ‘at 2:23, TURN DOWN’ because Uncle Pete's chirps were\nso loud,” Kate recalls.\n<br /><br />\nWhen all was said and done, the album had become every bit as rich and varied as the time in their lives that it capped\nthe end of.\n<br /><br />\n“It was a really rewarding and emotional process making Walls,” Damon says. “We could kind of reflect on what a crazy\ntwo and a half years we'd had. When we finished up I felt like I could breathe again, like a massive weight had been\nlifted. The warm Vancouver summer felt like an old friend guiding us though it all. It was a really exciting time.” — Dave\nMorris","hometown":"Australia","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/an-horse","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Anyone who’s ever punched a clock has a work buddy.

It’s also an opportunity to reflect on the fantastical journey that has carried them here, a\npipe dream made thrillingly real.\n<br /><br />\n“We'd worked in the record store together for a couple of years and talked every day — even on days off — mostly\nabout music and film, which we continue to do every day now.” says Damon. “After listening to music all day together at\nwork for two years, we had a really clear idea of what we liked and disliked musically.” That bond was the backbone of\nRearrange Beds; after two years of relentless touring, though, including stints out on the road with Tegan & Sara, Death\nCab For Cutie, Cage the Elephant, Silversun Pickups and The Big Pink, An Horse had become a different animal\naltogether.\n<br /><br />\nCooper, like Cox, is frank in her assessment of their earlier album. “With Rearrange Beds, we made a record of two\npeople learning how to play together. I don't think you can hear that on the album per se, but that's what it was.” This\ntime, the pair decided to make a record that reflected their bond not just as music aficionados, but as musical\ncollaborators. “Walls was really deliberate,” Kate explains. “We had hundreds of shows under our belt and we had\nfigured out how to play off each other.”\n<br /><br />\nRegrouping in Vancouver after recharging their batteries in their respective homes — Cooper in Montreal, Cox in\nMelbourne — An Horse brought in Howard Redekopp (who has lent his sonic wizardry to The New Pornographers and\nTegan and Sara as well as An Horse — Redekopp mixed Rearrange Beds) to produce the album. Now the duo would\nfigure out how to play off the studio, too.\n<br /><br />\n“We had many lengthy discussions with Howard before we arrived in Vancouver to record,” says Damon, “and did five\ndays of pre-production — pulling the songs apart, putting them back together, throwing some songs away and even\ncreating new ones — which is something we'd never had the luxury of doing.”\n<br /><br />\nThe atmosphere was comfortable and creative, which was just what they needed. “During the recording, Howard\nbrought his old dog Fanny into the studio,” Kate explains with a wry chuckle. “One day I was getting up in Fanny's face\nwhile Damon was recording with a video camera. I was talking to her, telling her she was such a lovely dog, but Howard\nquickly intervened when he found us. He told us that Fanny had personal space issues and, had I gotten any closer,\nFanny would have had my nose! A few weeks earlier, Fanny had bitten our assistant engineer Jaret's face and he had\nto be rushed to the hospital with Fanny sitting beside him in the car.”\n<br /><br />\nWalls has plenty of the whip-smart, energetic rock that propelled An Horse half-way across the world. The album’s\nopening track, “Dressed Sharply,” is as fizzy and explosive as a shook-up bottle of champagne, spraying the listener\nwith showers of melody and noise. It’s no surprise that the tune is a fan favorite already, thanks to having been\npreviewed in their recent shows. But on the song that follows it, “Not Mine,” the craft and care that went into Walls’\nmaking becomes even clearer. Kate and Damon’s passionate vocals, weave into a pattern with Kate’s chiming guitar,\nbuilding the intensity slowly and deliberately as Damon’s drums nudge the momentum along.\n<br /><br />\nIt’s a powerful tension, one that marks the separation between Rearrange Beds and Walls, where the duo frequently\nreturn to that place where anything can shrink into a whisper or explode into a howl. “They’re my favorite songs on the\nrecord; songs like ‘100 Whales,’ where the mood fits in the middle. We wanted to make a record that sounded way\nbigger and more powerful, but not so big and crazy that it didn't sound like two people,” Damon says.\n<br /><br />\nThe result is a towering sound that doesn’t buckle when it gets quiet, or for that matter, serious. Walls’ songs span a\nwide spectrum of emotions, which came to the surface after Kate had moved to Montreal. “I was really stoked because I\nhad met a girl and was having a good time, but there were also a lot of really terrible things that had happened.”\nMore specifically, the lyrics deal with the wrenching angst of being stuck on tour while a family member falls ill. Plenty of\nsongwriters have observed the monotony of endless hours logged on the interstate, but when your mom phones you to\ntell you that she has to have major surgery and you can’t run to her side all the way in Australia, suddenly you’ve got\nbigger problems than the lack of roadside scenery between Buffalo and Pittsburgh.\n<br /><br />\n“No one in my family told me about my mom’s condition because they didn’t want me to come home,” Kate explains.\n“They said, ‘we didn’t want to worry you.’ So eventually I had this conversation with my mum where she said, ‘Alright,\nwell, I’m gonna go in now and get this done,’ and I was, like, ‘Alright, bye…’ it was crazy. I was struck with this sense\nthat I would have to spend as much time with everyone I care about now because they could die, but I’m going to be on\ntour, so I can’t.”\n<br /><br />\nThere’s a disarming intimacy in Kate’s lyrics, whether she’s relating the experience of waiting for her mom’s results in\n“Brain on a Table,” or the less dramatic but vividly observed “Windows in the City,” where she describes games people\nmake up on the phone when things like geography or work come between them. Both a sense of playfulness and\nfeelings of longing are never far from the surface.\n<br /><br />\nKate: “I think most of the songs for Walls were written in December 2009 to January 2010, when I was in Montreal. I\nwas discovering a new city but I was missing everyone back home. And I was definitely getting frustrated with feeling\nlost.\n<br /><br />\n“When it’s minus 30 degrees out and my girlfriend’s working and my friends are away, and it’s like, what do I do in this\napartment? I just wrote songs. Which was cool, I was really productive.\n<br /><br />\n”In the apartment, there was a bird that wouldn’t shut up. His name was Uncle Pete and his painful ‘cheep cheep’ is all\nover the demos. I had to send them to Damon with notes like ‘at 2:23, TURN DOWN’ because Uncle Pete's chirps were\nso loud,” Kate recalls.\n<br /><br />\nWhen all was said and done, the album had become every bit as rich and varied as the time in their lives that it capped\nthe end of.\n<br /><br />\n“It was a really rewarding and emotional process making Walls,” Damon says. “We could kind of reflect on what a crazy\ntwo and a half years we'd had. When we finished up I felt like I could breathe again, like a massive weight had been\nlifted. The warm Vancouver summer felt like an old friend guiding us though it all. It was a really exciting time.” — Dave\nMorris","musicbrainz_id":null},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14939/sq_90.jpg","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14939/original.jpg","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/111375.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"22","location":"Lineup - Perrys","tier":"4"}},"main_lineup_position":"5950","twitter_username":"anatijoux","setlist":null,"title":"Ana Tijoux","updated_at":"2011-05-05 19:44:55 -0500","youtube_id":"yiQ7S38nKog","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/125587.json","title":"Los Bunkers"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/41491.json","title":"Iration"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/73642.json","title":"Chico Trujillo"}]},"flickr_tag":"anatijoux","id":"111375","echonest_id":"ARJBRXF129CDBEFF1E","homepage":"http://anatijoux.com/","myspace_link":null,"fan_count":"196","description":"Regarded by many as the best rapper in the Spanish language, Ana Tijoux's career has spanned 10 years of pure hits.

Recorded at Sound City Studios in Los Angeles with long-time producer/ collaborator James Ford, it has a summery pop feel: with the bulk of work completed on the West Coast during January, it’s got the feel-good sound of stealing some winter sun, some out of season Vitamin D.\n<br /><br />\n‘Everyone was in a really good mood when we were there,’ says Alex Turner; ‘so I think the fact we were having a laugh comes across. When I’ve played it to friends they’ve said “it sounds like you’re having a really good time”, I think we wanted it to sound quite fun and up, not too serious’. \n<br /><br />\n‘It were more about making it more of a trip and an experience I suppose, going somewhere to do the record,’ says Matt Helders about the decision to record in LA; ‘we knew we wanted to go somewhere and do it and it were gray and horrible here’. Alex: ‘We were there for five weeks, a good stretch. But it were different to the last album when we went out to the desert and it was re-ally all about that experience and feeling far away’.  \n<br /><br />\n‘We were looking at places to record and that one seemed to tick all the boxes. The studio we were in (Sound City) there’s been some greats… there’s a really good drum room, that was a big draw, it’s where they did “Nevermind” [Nir-vana].’ ‘They were all saying it’s the best drum room in the world,’ adds Matt, ‘so it was a bit of pressure, no excuse to fuck it up!!  Laughter better play something good then!’\n<br /><br />\nFor “Suck It and See” the Monkeys changed the way they work, as Alex ex-plains: ‘the plan this time was to get the songs together early on and have them be the guide. In the past perhaps it’s come from a riff or like different drum parts kicking around and then we’d piece it together. This time we’ve thought a lot more about what each finished song required in terms of its musical parts and the best way to realise it. We have done a little bit of that before but perhaps not as much as on this one.’\n<br /><br />\nSuiting the album’s pop approach, “Suck It and See” is much more arranged than the last album, “Humbug”, with Jamie Cook’s guitar a particular revela-tion: adding flavour, excitement and a variety of textures in short bursts. Alex: ‘I suppose just that it was a decision to try and make things as simple as pos-sible, to get the sounds together and then try and do as little as we could and leave quite a lot of space and not do a lot of overdubs and organs’.\n<br /><br />\nMatt:  ‘We cut live and recorded – no cheating!’\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘Not fix anything, we spent all the time rehearsing so that we could play them well enough to not keep going through and fixing the tapes.  And even if there is a little bit in there we just left it’.\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘Once you start fixing things you can get too obsessive as well, every little thing.  Once you know you can easily sort it out with a computer the temptation is there. Even if you know you’ve done something wrong you know you can sort it out which a lot of people must do nowadays, Yeah everything’s perfect; ironed out’.\n<br /><br />\nThe album’s twelve songs vary in pace and texture, with Alex Turner’s vocals taking a more sophisticated, smoother approach – no less humorous or blunt, but a different pitch, more insinuating. ‘It’s kind of got lower as times go on,’ he reflects about his voice. ‘I think a lot of these ones I wrote at home on an acoustic guitar sort of sitting and when I do that I tend to sing softly and qui-etly and low and usually too low’.  \n<br /><br />\n‘So when we get it in with the band we have to move it up a couple of tones to get it to sit right.  That’s something we never really looked at before like the key – getting the right key for things – cos we you used to get in and bash things out and it would take you too long to change the key so you’d just fuck-ing leave it Laughter but yeah that’s where I’m comfortable now singing in, there’s a bit more space I suppose, its not quite as rapid as it used to be’.\n<br /><br />\n‘We had a discussion before we began, about what we wanted this to be this time and one thing we all agreed were we wanted to get really good songs ar-ranged and then hopefully the rest you can work out without the initial tunes there otherwise you might run into trouble.  So I think that just meant me try-ing to listen to good song writers which I suppose meant listening to a bit of John Cale, I got into him a lot over the last years, and the Velvet Underground as well but his solo records like “Fear”.’ \n<br /><br />\n‘And I started getting into Country music which is something I’ve never gone anywhere near until quite recently, like I never understood it before. I know I’m never going to write a country tune, laughter, that just wouldn’t work but for that reason I can draw something from it. They’re really sort of smart arses sometimes those guys, like George Jones and that kind of thing. The sound doesn’t speak to me but the lyrics do’. \n<br /><br />\n“Suck It and See” is full of songs that chart the twists and turns of sex and love with elemental imagery, sharp lyrics and great pop-cultural metaphors – with references to past rock’n roll classics (‘you look like you’ve been for breakfast at the Heartbreak Hotel’) different kinds of soft drinks (Dandelion and Bur-dock, Postmix Lemonade) and arcane 21st century leisure pursuits (Laser-quest).\n<br /><br />\n‘I were thinking about this yesterday,’ says Alex about the wide open weather imagery of “Thunderstorm” and “Black Treacle”, ‘and the reason for this may-be could be, I realised this is the first time I’ve written not on the ground floor. Because I wrote most of the album in New York in the flat on the 4th floor so…’ \n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘it’s being closer to the sky’. \n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘yeah looking out of the window and there being a lot more sky…’\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘’like Australia – the sky’s further away…’\n<br /><br />\nLaughter\n<br /><br />\nFor fans of Turner’s lyrics, there are some classic lines: ‘trust some ellipses to chase you round the room’ (“Library Pictures”); ‘the type of kiss where teeth collide’ (“Reckless Serenade”); ‘I’m sure you’re still breaking hearts with all the efficiency that only youth can harness’ (“Laserquest”). \n<br /><br />\nOne of the best lines comes in the title track “Suck It and See”: ‘I poured my aching heart into a pop song, I couldn’t get the hang of poetry’. How much are these lyrics autobiographical? ‘It’s not accurate at all, Alex admits.  ‘Because I think that’s something that I have done before and like I used to really write about exactly the situation that happened and after a while I sort of wished I hadn’t.’\n<br /><br />\n‘And I don’t know if it is harder for everyone else to enjoy then as well if it’s your thing.  I’m more into making songs the best they can be and I think to do that you don’t want to put too much of yourself but I think you have to do a bit because it can go too much the other way.  That’s something I’ve done as well. And with poetry I feel like it’s just like a couple of leagues up, you’re not hid-ing behind a melody’. \n<br /><br />\nThe album also contains several great rockers (“Library Pictures”) but two in particular stand out. The first, “Brick by Brick” has a killer riff and Matt Held-ers on his first full band vocal: ‘it was very enjoyable’, he says. The track origi-nated in a band catch-phrase. Alex: ‘we got off a long flight once and we were in Miami, we were sort of sitting around in the bar and had an idea for a song called “Brick by Brick” and we kind of just wrote it through that night’.\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘it were like an ongoing thing for a long time…’\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘a few weeks yeah’.\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘different lines, there were probably a thousand options, you could put anything in’.\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘whatever you want to do as long as it’s “Brick by Brick”, so we went through this and the list was probably three times as long as it ended up…’\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘feed your child…’ laughs\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘we never like kind of wrote down what it were…’\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘yeah even down to when it we were at the studio there were like slight changes…’ \n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘the only thing we knew we were going to have three “I wanna rock and roll”s, cos one rock and roll  is funny, two rock and rolls is a bit funnier but three is just fucking awesome!’\n<br /><br />\nOn the first single “Don’t Sit Down ‘Cause I’ve Moved Your Chair” the band itemise various things that you shouldn’t do: ‘wear your shell suit on bonfire night’, ‘do the Macarena in the devil’s lair’. Alex: ‘that song is an idea rather than you sort of sitting down and writing a letter or something. There’s a few we’ve had like that before and this is definitely one of them. “Brick by Brick” is very much an idea. You think we’re going to have a song and then you just make a list of things and that list will be too long at first and then you shorten it down’.\n<br /><br />\n‘But yeah “Don’t Sit Down ‘Cause…” was that somebody said that once.  I was in the studio with James Ford and the engineer or whatever, I pinched his seat and he was fiddling around plugging something in and I said “don’t sit down because I’ve moved your chair” and James started laughing and said “that sounds like it would be a 60s garage tune or something like that”, laughter and then he said “you should write that”.’  \n<br /><br />\n‘So then I thought if you can’t sit down because I’ve moved your chair what list of ridiculous things can you do that are like more dangerous or risky, cos like sitting down would be dangerous, that’s what we’re really focusing on, we re-ally don’t want him to sit down but he can do whatever else he likes’.\n<br /><br />\nLet’s go back to those soft-drink references on the anthemic title track, “Suck It and See”….\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘Dandelion & Burdock is a rare fizzy drink, English I think.’\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘yeah probably not even so much down in London I don’t think.  I was watching Saturday Kitchen one week and he used it in a recipe and he’s from Leeds or whatever and Louise Redknapp had never heard of it before she were like ‘what’s this…’\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘Apparently John Paul Jones really likes it as well….’\n<br /><br />\nLaughter\n<br /><br />\nMatt: It’s good, I should incorporate it into drinking vodka. I do have them quite regularly because well I know where to get them laughs like its always in chip shops. It’s really quite sweet’.\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘and then postmix lemonade you have a lot more often so I thought that would be quite a good analogy to compliment a woman laughter if she’s … \n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘one of a kind…’\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘yeah ‘you’re rare’ … and doing that with a fizzy drink seemed quite fun-ny’.\n<br /><br />\nArctic Monkeys are Jamie Cook, Matt Helders, Nick O’Malley and Alex Turner. “Suck It and See” is their fourth album. It contains twelve songs, in-cluding a reworking of “Piledriver Waltz” from the Turner written soundtrack to Richard Ayoade’s film “Submarine” (also released on Domino). It is re-leased on Monday the 6th of June 2011, preceded by the first single “Don’t Sit Down ‘Cause I’ve Moved Your Chair”.\n<br /><br />\nBut wait a minute: what about that album title? A reference to last album “Humbug”, or what?\n<br /><br />\nAlex: I guess it is in a way but we struggle with putting a title on a record and have done every time and I dunno… To be honest we just thought that, out of all of the song titles, that was the one that made most sense. That’s quite a nice phrase, it’s an old British phrase.’ \n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘It’s a bit “Carry On”….’","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/arctic-monkeys","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Light and airy, filmic but intimate, carefully arranged but deceptively power-ful, “Suck It and See” is Arctic Monkeys’ fourth album.

The sound doesn’t speak to me but the lyrics do’. \n<br /><br />\n“Suck It and See” is full of songs that chart the twists and turns of sex and love with elemental imagery, sharp lyrics and great pop-cultural metaphors – with references to past rock’n roll classics (‘you look like you’ve been for breakfast at the Heartbreak Hotel’) different kinds of soft drinks (Dandelion and Bur-dock, Postmix Lemonade) and arcane 21st century leisure pursuits (Laser-quest).\n<br /><br />\n‘I were thinking about this yesterday,’ says Alex about the wide open weather imagery of “Thunderstorm” and “Black Treacle”, ‘and the reason for this may-be could be, I realised this is the first time I’ve written not on the ground floor. Because I wrote most of the album in New York in the flat on the 4th floor so…’ \n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘it’s being closer to the sky’. \n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘yeah looking out of the window and there being a lot more sky…’\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘’like Australia – the sky’s further away…’\n<br /><br />\nLaughter\n<br /><br />\nFor fans of Turner’s lyrics, there are some classic lines: ‘trust some ellipses to chase you round the room’ (“Library Pictures”); ‘the type of kiss where teeth collide’ (“Reckless Serenade”); ‘I’m sure you’re still breaking hearts with all the efficiency that only youth can harness’ (“Laserquest”). \n<br /><br />\nOne of the best lines comes in the title track “Suck It and See”: ‘I poured my aching heart into a pop song, I couldn’t get the hang of poetry’. How much are these lyrics autobiographical? ‘It’s not accurate at all, Alex admits.  ‘Because I think that’s something that I have done before and like I used to really write about exactly the situation that happened and after a while I sort of wished I hadn’t.’\n<br /><br />\n‘And I don’t know if it is harder for everyone else to enjoy then as well if it’s your thing.  I’m more into making songs the best they can be and I think to do that you don’t want to put too much of yourself but I think you have to do a bit because it can go too much the other way.  That’s something I’ve done as well. And with poetry I feel like it’s just like a couple of leagues up, you’re not hid-ing behind a melody’. \n<br /><br />\nThe album also contains several great rockers (“Library Pictures”) but two in particular stand out. The first, “Brick by Brick” has a killer riff and Matt Held-ers on his first full band vocal: ‘it was very enjoyable’, he says. The track origi-nated in a band catch-phrase. Alex: ‘we got off a long flight once and we were in Miami, we were sort of sitting around in the bar and had an idea for a song called “Brick by Brick” and we kind of just wrote it through that night’.\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘it were like an ongoing thing for a long time…’\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘a few weeks yeah’.\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘different lines, there were probably a thousand options, you could put anything in’.\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘whatever you want to do as long as it’s “Brick by Brick”, so we went through this and the list was probably three times as long as it ended up…’\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘feed your child…’ laughs\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘we never like kind of wrote down what it were…’\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘yeah even down to when it we were at the studio there were like slight changes…’ \n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘the only thing we knew we were going to have three “I wanna rock and roll”s, cos one rock and roll  is funny, two rock and rolls is a bit funnier but three is just fucking awesome!’\n<br /><br />\nOn the first single “Don’t Sit Down ‘Cause I’ve Moved Your Chair” the band itemise various things that you shouldn’t do: ‘wear your shell suit on bonfire night’, ‘do the Macarena in the devil’s lair’. Alex: ‘that song is an idea rather than you sort of sitting down and writing a letter or something. There’s a few we’ve had like that before and this is definitely one of them. “Brick by Brick” is very much an idea. You think we’re going to have a song and then you just make a list of things and that list will be too long at first and then you shorten it down’.\n<br /><br />\n‘But yeah “Don’t Sit Down ‘Cause…” was that somebody said that once.  I was in the studio with James Ford and the engineer or whatever, I pinched his seat and he was fiddling around plugging something in and I said “don’t sit down because I’ve moved your chair” and James started laughing and said “that sounds like it would be a 60s garage tune or something like that”, laughter and then he said “you should write that”.’  \n<br /><br />\n‘So then I thought if you can’t sit down because I’ve moved your chair what list of ridiculous things can you do that are like more dangerous or risky, cos like sitting down would be dangerous, that’s what we’re really focusing on, we re-ally don’t want him to sit down but he can do whatever else he likes’.\n<br /><br />\nLet’s go back to those soft-drink references on the anthemic title track, “Suck It and See”….\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘Dandelion & Burdock is a rare fizzy drink, English I think.’\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘yeah probably not even so much down in London I don’t think.  I was watching Saturday Kitchen one week and he used it in a recipe and he’s from Leeds or whatever and Louise Redknapp had never heard of it before she were like ‘what’s this…’\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘Apparently John Paul Jones really likes it as well….’\n<br /><br />\nLaughter\n<br /><br />\nMatt: It’s good, I should incorporate it into drinking vodka. I do have them quite regularly because well I know where to get them laughs like its always in chip shops. It’s really quite sweet’.\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘and then postmix lemonade you have a lot more often so I thought that would be quite a good analogy to compliment a woman laughter if she’s … \n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘one of a kind…’\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘yeah ‘you’re rare’ … and doing that with a fizzy drink seemed quite fun-ny’.\n<br /><br />\nArctic Monkeys are Jamie Cook, Matt Helders, Nick O’Malley and Alex Turner. “Suck It and See” is their fourth album. It contains twelve songs, in-cluding a reworking of “Piledriver Waltz” from the Turner written soundtrack to Richard Ayoade’s film “Submarine” (also released on Domino). It is re-leased on Monday the 6th of June 2011, preceded by the first single “Don’t Sit Down ‘Cause I’ve Moved Your Chair”.\n<br /><br />\nBut wait a minute: what about that album title? A reference to last album “Humbug”, or what?\n<br /><br />\nAlex: I guess it is in a way but we struggle with putting a title on a record and have done every time and I dunno… To be honest we just thought that, out of all of the song titles, that was the one that made most sense. That’s quite a nice phrase, it’s an old British phrase.’ \n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘It’s a bit “Carry On”….’","musicbrainz_id":null},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14885/sq_90.JPG","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14885/original.JPG","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/14587.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"22","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"4"}},"main_lineup_position":"1100","twitter_username":"atmosphere","setlist":null,"title":"Atmosphere","updated_at":"2011-05-05 19:44:55 -0500","youtube_id":"N0chdjyvOIQ","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/138682.json","title":"Eminem"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/17848.json","title":"KiD CuDi"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/120771.json","title":"Tinie Tempah"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/123291.json","title":"Cee Lo Green"}]},"flickr_tag":"atmosphere","id":"14587","echonest_id":"ARZYMH91187B99CEFC","homepage":"http://www.rhymesayers.com/atmosphere/","myspace_link":"http://www.myspace.com/atmosphere","fan_count":"4795","description":"In the three years since Atmosphere's dropped a full length record on the world, they've been far from stagnant, staying at the top of their game in every respect.

The answer is Best Coast, the latest musical endeavor by perennially cool, self-described “weird girl” Bethany Cosentino. Best Coast was born when Cosentino decided to come home to LA after a time in New York City, to get a fresh start at living in the place she knows best—California. Quickly garnering praise from critics and listeners with the single “Sun Was High (So Was I),” Cosentino was approached by UK-based label Blackest Rainbow, who released her now sold-out tape Where the Boys Are. Also in the works are two new 7-inch’s, one being released by San Diego-based Art Fag Recordings and the other, the debut release from brand-new Brooklyn label Group Tightener.\n<br /><br />\nA Los Angeles native, Cosentino grew tired of what she had grown up with and did what so many have done before—she picked up and left for the East Coast, specifically Brooklyn, with the intention of going to art school for Creative Writing. “I was like, I hate the beach, I hate flip flops. I want to go to New York.” But Brooklyn quickly turned out to be far different from what she had envisioned. “I realized that I actually liked all those things, they reminded me of home,” and life in New York was too cold, both literally and figuratively, with too many people trying way too hard, “it’s like, there are people in New York who look like they’re at the beach sometimes but it’s not real, it’s not the same.”\n<br /><br />\nLooking for a way to get a taste of her native land all the way in Brooklyn, Cosentino was drawn to the ‘50’s and ‘60’s aesthetic of The Beach Boys and The Everly Brothers, which, she says, “made me happy.” Creating her own little Southern California in her bedroom wasn’t enough, however, and one weekend Cosentino decided enough was enough. “One weekend I just decided to leave New York. Two days later I was back in LA,” Cosentino says matter-of-factly. She started making music almost immediately, having been “inspired by the music I was listening to in New York,” Cosentino “wanted to be making the music I wanted to listen to.” Because of this, the project’s aesthetic is intended and natural, a combination of Cosentino’s influences and her inherent Californian-ness.\n<br /><br />\nAlthough Best Coast began in her bedroom, with Cosentino recording demo’s all on her own, she soon realized that she could use a little bit of help getting the vibe exactly right.

Cosentino and Bruno have been friends since Cosentino was a teenager, and she knew right away that he was someone she could trust with her project; “Bobb’s from California, he grew up here, he understands,” Cosentino says, adding that “he really, totally just gets it.”\n<br /><br />\nBest Coast sounds the way music sounds when it comes over the beach from the parking lot, where the cutest boy in school is getting out of his car. The perfect combination of that naïve and nervous excitement of a youthful crush and the fuzzy, think reverb of having been around the block at least once before, Best Coast evokes a nostalgia for the California of Gidget and dates at the soda fountain without forgetting that it is that same California that would later spawn Charles Manson. Cosentino is constantly playing with these dichotomies, as well as toying with the line between childhood and adulthood, “in New York there was this intense pressure to be a grown-up,” she says, “but here, it’s more laid back, and everyone’s a little bit afraid of growing up.” But by embracing the innocence of summer, of crushes and of the sometimes silly sadness of first heartbreaks with sophisticated songwriting and an impeccably well-crafted sound, Cosentino has captured what makes California great—that you can go to work and have a job and be a grown-up while still knowing that you can hop in the car with your friends and drive to the beach, anytime you want.","hometown":"LOS ANGELES, California","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/best-coast","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Combine the sophisticated chill of a New York City winter with the girlish, laid back romance of California in the summertime and what to you get?

Cosentino is constantly playing with these dichotomies, as well as toying with the line between childhood and adulthood, “in New York there was this intense pressure to be a grown-up,” she says, “but here, it’s more laid back, and everyone’s a little bit afraid of growing up.” But by embracing the innocence of summer, of crushes and of the sometimes silly sadness of first heartbreaks with sophisticated songwriting and an impeccably well-crafted sound, Cosentino has captured what makes California great—that you can go to work and have a job and be a grown-up while still knowing that you can hop in the car with your friends and drive to the beach, anytime you want.","musicbrainz_id":null},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14985/sq_90.jpg","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14985/original.jpg","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/146525.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"14","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"4"}},"main_lineup_position":"700","twitter_username":"bigaudiodyn","setlist":null,"title":"Big Audio Dynamite","updated_at":"2011-05-05 19:44:55 -0500","youtube_id":"rPrPNpzLHIk","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/133581.json","title":"The Cars"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/34218.json","title":"Muse"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/40813.json","title":"TAB the band"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/26512.json","title":"White Lies"}]},"flickr_tag":"bigaudiodynamite","id":"146525","echonest_id":"ARCEOW71187B9A5A71","homepage":"http://www.bigaudiodynamite.co.uk/","myspace_link":null,"fan_count":"1351","description":"“Born from the ashes of the Clash,” is how Don Letts puts it, referring to the cosmic implosion in 1983, after seven glorious years, of the original lineup of “the only band that really mattered.”  Parting ways with the band for ‘ideological differences’ (as rock lore has always noted), free agent Mick Jones was free to set the stage for the arrival two years later of Big Audio Dynamite.\n<br /><br />\nThat arrival (October 1985) came in the form of This Is Big Audio Dynamite, a monumental and influential album of British post-punk rock revisionism ‘clashing’ head-on with hip-hop beatboxes (pre-Beastie Boys and Fatboy Slim and Run-DMC’s hip-hop-rock fusion projects), dancefloor grooves, the Vocoder (precursor of T-Pain’s Auto-tune), and eye-opening, ear-bending cinematic samples gathered up from spaghetti westerns, Nic Roeg films and more. \n This Is Big Audio Dynamite raised the curtain on a band that challenged the imprint of the Clash, in terms of both recorded output (11 albums, including those by B.A.D.

Conor Oberst has spent much of the last few years recording and touring with friends and musicians, The Mystic Valley Band, as well as releasing a a highly acclaimed album and tour as part of the so called indie supergroup Monsters of Folk.","musicbrainz_id":null},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14929/sq_90.JPG","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14929/original.JPG","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/45206.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"13","location":"Lineup - Perrys","tier":"4"}},"main_lineup_position":"5400","twitter_username":"edbangerrecords","setlist":null,"title":"Busy P","updated_at":"2011-05-05 19:44:55 -0500","youtube_id":"t-u2U9iekjQ","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/83670.json","title":"Chuckie"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/154508.json","title":"Feed Me"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/64395.json","title":"MIDNIGHT CONSPIRACY"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/127743.json","title":"Modeselektor"}]},"flickr_tag":"busyp","id":"45206","echonest_id":"AR25JPR1187B99720B'","homepage":"http://www.edbangerrecords.com/","myspace_link":"http://www.myspace.com/busyp","fan_count":"486","description":"Ten years after Daft Punk announced the arrival of French Touch – the invasion of mainly beat-led and sometimes filtered electronic music that spawned hits for everyone from Air to Zdar – a new wave of music is making Paris a hotbed of creation.

But the struggles never pushed singer Matt Shultz, guitarist Brad Shultz, bassist Daniel Tichenor, guitarist Lincoln Parish, and drummer Jared Champion off track — they only strengthened the group's bond and fueled the revved-up roar of its new album, set for release on January 11, 2011, which promises to launch the new year with a ferocious kick of gut-grabbing rock & roll.\n<br /><br />\n\"This album brought me back to life,\" says Matt Shultz. \"We totally turned away from fear-based writing.

Some songs are a direct attack on myself.\"\n<br /><br />\n\"Shake Me Down\" is packed with explosive loud-quiet-loud interludes that showcase Champion's skills on a set of toy drums that were expertly recorded by Jay Joyce, who also produced Cage the Elephant's debut. The guitar riff was actually borrowed from a song Tichenor's dad had written years ago (\"I ripped him off,\" the bassist jokes), and the bass line was inspired by the Shins. \n<br /><br />\nOne of the band's biggest goals for the disc — not to conform to a popular sound or look — became a bit of a crusade. \"Sell Yourself\" is a ferocious, thrashing ode to staying true to their identity despite the pressures of the industry. \"Indy Kidz\" skewers the pretentiousness of music scenes where everyone just wants to fit in before it stretches out into a trippy jam. And Matt Shultz breaks out his best Frank Black yell to let off steam on \"Tangled,\" one of several amped-up songs he's looking forward to tearing apart live during the band's mind-blowingly energetic shows.

They are the soundtrack to every party in the country--from Arica to Punta Arenas--and its hard to pass a day without hearing one of their songs sung by your taxicab driver, blasting from the speakers while you walk by a store, or being sung by a group of youngsters in the park. Their mixture of classic cumbia and hints of rock and ska has assured them audiences from every generation and every walk of life. They are truly a national phenomenon, performing more than 200 shows a year, and sometimes 2 or 3 times in the same day, always sold out, always a line to get in. Since 2005 they have been exporting their high-energy party vibe to the world, and \"Chico de Oro\" is their first international release, compiling their biggest hits in one long-playing disc, a perfect primer for every fan before experiencing the real deal: the live show.\n<br /><br />\nStarted as an offshoot of punk/ska band LaFloripondio in 1999, this \"side-project\" quickly surpassed their predecessors and came to symbolize a uniquely Chilean cocktail, one that is rooted in the cumbias of the pre-Pinochet days, but manages to incorporate at the same time nearly every aspect of Chile's popular culture. They have meshed bits and pieces of Chile's fragmented past with the global influence of alternative culture and merged it all under the pan-Latin banner of cumbia, and have somehow come to define current Chilean life; their is no other entity--whether it be music, art, film, or politics--that so embodies the current feel of the country. Some have called them the \"Superheros of Cumbia,\" and comparisons start with what Gogol Bordello did with Gypsy music--taking a more \"world\" genre and making it popular for the masses -- and go from there.

They are the soundtrack to every party in the country--from Arica to Punta Arenas--and its hard to pass a day without hearing one of their songs sung by your taxicab driver, blasting from the speakers while you walk by a store, or being sung by a group of youngsters in the park. Their mixture of classic cumbia and hints of rock and ska has assured them audiences from every generation and every walk of life. They are truly a national phenomenon, performing more than 200 shows a year, and sometimes 2 or 3 times in the same day, always sold out, always a line to get in. Since 2005 they have been exporting their high-energy party vibe to the world, and \"Chico de Oro\" is their first international release, compiling their biggest hits in one long-playing disc, a perfect primer for every fan before experiencing the real deal: the live show.\n<br /><br />\nStarted as an offshoot of punk/ska band LaFloripondio in 1999, this \"side-project\" quickly surpassed their predecessors and came to symbolize a uniquely Chilean cocktail, one that is rooted in the cumbias of the pre-Pinochet days, but manages to incorporate at the same time nearly every aspect of Chile's popular culture. They have meshed bits and pieces of Chile's fragmented past with the global influence of alternative culture and merged it all under the pan-Latin banner of cumbia, and have somehow come to define current Chilean life; their is no other entity--whether it be music, art, film, or politics--that so embodies the current feel of the country. Some have called them the \"Superheros of Cumbia,\" and comparisons start with what Gogol Bordello did with Gypsy music--taking a more \"world\" genre and making it popular for the masses -- and go from there. But they do it with no marketing, no sponsors, seemingly no plan. They were cumbia before cumbia was cool. Zero pretensions, and practically zero intentions. They just go out and have a good time, throw a party ... and the world follows.","musicbrainz_id":null},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14964/sq_90.jpg","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14964/original.jpg","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/120117.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"83","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"5"}},"main_lineup_position":"4050","twitter_username":"CHRISTINAPERRI","setlist":null,"title":"Christina Perri","updated_at":"2011-05-26 03:43:42 -0500","youtube_id":"8v_4O44sfjM","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/117345.json","title":"The Pretty Reckless"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/44391.json","title":"Kerli"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/201583.json","title":"Skylar Grey"}]},"flickr_tag":"christinaperri","id":"120117","echonest_id":"ARFDKIH129F1DDFB09","homepage":"http://www.christinaperri.com/","myspace_link":"http://www.myspace.com/christinaperri","fan_count":"1526","description":"In July 2010, a struggling singer-songwriter and musician named Christina Perri had a life-changing moment when she was asked to perform a song she had written, a defiant break-up anthem called \"Jar of Hearts,\" on the Fox show So You Think You Can Dance.
