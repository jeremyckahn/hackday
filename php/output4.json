Her mother giving birth to her standing up and without anaesthesia was a manifestation of the revolutionary hospital’s credo  –  “Being born on a woman’s terms” and possibly the first confrontation with womankind to found Lykke Li’s struggle with the concept of belonging. \n<br /><br />\nThe Zachrissons were the family that wouldn’t sit still, moving from Sweden to New Zealand, to Portugal where they settled in a mountain village to escape radiation in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. A compliant rebel child whose first steps were taken barefoot on sharp pebbles to the sound of peacocks and thunder, spending her winters in India, Nepal and Morocco, her school years in 11 different establishments, Lykke soon turned to scribbling poetry and dancing, not out of interest but out of necessity. When the family moved back to Sweden several years later, the now nine year old was already a wanderer by nature, restless and ancient at heart.\n<br /><br />\nAt 19, dancing was no longer enough of an outlet for Lykke Li’s increasingly loud soul, singing what she felt became the beginning of a cure for the ailments of youth and the confinement of Stockholm suburbs. So she took her business to New York, toughed things out in Bushwick, hustled and bustled, uptown and down. Waking up in her rat infested closet of a flat the morning after getting booed off stage at an open mic night with the hard knock conviction that “This is as rough as it gets. It’s all downhill from here”, \nshe knew that artistry in what ever form would always be her life. \n<br /><br />\nBadabing Badaboom.\n<br /><br />\nBack in Stockholm, broke and alone but ready to rumble, Lykke copped the ears of producer Björn Yttling (from Peter, Bjorn & John) and found in him a Henry Higgins to her Billy The Kid as he became the one to initiate her into the world of recording and writing songs for an honest living.\n<br /><br />\nIn 2007 the pair recorded the 14 songs that would become Lykke Li’s acclaimed debut album Youth Novels, a release that quickly gained notoriety, setting the 21 year old up for a breathtaking race around a world of claustrophobic backstage rooms, bright lights, indecent parties, busy airports, rotten people, beautiful strangers, wrinkled couture and stripper shoes, goodwill rags and butterfly knives in overworked suitcases. And heartbreak...\n<br /><br />\nGod bless heartbreak, and so say all of us, because out of it came the haunting song Possibility, taken from a severely beat up belief in love, written for the Twilight - New Moon movie and embraced by millions of young vampire hearts longing for the right not to belong. And love.\n<br /><br />\n”My last tango with love ended really badly, but you could say I broke my own heart. Love was just my tool and the heartache my ghost. Something to grab onto when everything else falls apart...”.\n<br /><br />\nAfter two manic years of practically every place, person and pleasure on the face of the earth calling for her attention - except for love - Lykke Li found herself in desperate need for a place to lay her head rather than another stage to fill. With no actual place to call home, she decided to take on New York once again, to live a little!\n<br /><br />\n“I spent two months there, just having a good time. But I was drained,\nNew York was the wrong place for me to be at the time. Too many bloodsuckers, it got the best of me. And once I pulled the plug, once I was quiet and alone and the flood of offers and invitations started to run dry, I had to think about who I was. And although my circumstances had changed so dramatically, although I had every opportunity I ever wanted, I still felt the same as before. The same existential anxiety, the same restlessness. I hadn’t changed with the world around me, I was holding on. I had to do something, I had to grow.’ \n<br /><br />\nAnd so Lykke Li fled west, into the California desert, starred in a trippy, dark Moses Berkson film called Solarium and buried part of her bruised heart \nin the scalding sand. The rest of it came with her to a house on a hill in east \nLos Angeles where she bought a bicycle and an autoharp, rented a not so grand piano, put some flowers ‘round her room, and sat down to think.\n<br /><br />\nSettled in, a little bit lonely and faced with the Gainsbourgeois fear that \nthe ghost of a love that never really lived will never cease to haunt you, will always stay inside you, unborn and undead, she turned to records for solace.\n<br /><br />\nThe Echo Park hilltop soon trembled with music stemming from minds of that same contemplative, refined, painful place. Leonard Cohen, Neil Young and Dr John mixed with the Velvet Underground and This Mortal Coil, all under the omnipresent hex of Alan Lomax’s field recordings, Whisky and Darjeeling.\n<br /><br />\nBut like anyone in the midst of longing and loss, Lykke Li was eager to recover and rediscover the essence of the music in her self. She found herself thirs-ting for the raw power of simplicity, for some form of straight up truth. \nShe came to the conclusion that regardless of any fear, any loss and any longing, it’s not about the pearl in the oyster but about the grain of sand that forms it. About the coal itself, not the diamond it could become. About the now that will inevitably turn into then, and the when that may never turn into now. \n<br /><br />\nAnd she began to write.\n<br /><br />\n“I wanted back to the beginning, to where songs meant something. I wanted minimalism, just lyrics and melodies. Like all great songs, I wanted mine to really stand the test of being played with nothing but handclaps and vocals.”\n<br /><br />\nChanneling the demise of The Shangri La’s leader of the pack, women under the influence, ladies and gentlemen of the canyon, a Kung-fu Marianne Faithful and an armed Nancy Sinatra on peyote, she made music. Out of her head came voodoo drums, a few aching chords, churning and unholy, staggering and lolloping, and a voice that had suddenly turned from yearning to demanding, from fragile to undressed.\n<br /><br />\n“When I sing… it’s always about my most private emotions, I wouldn’t talk to anyone about them. But it’s my stage, my space, where I can express as much as I want. Either way, I set the boundaries, I make the rules. You can’t come in.”\n<br /><br />\n‘These scars of mine make wounded rhymes tonight’, she sings, putting her sophomore album’s title into context. A second born album demanding the right not to belong, convinced that it does all the same, from a performer of equal parts life and afterlife, love and destruction, fight and faith.\n<br /><br />\n“This could be it, you know. Really. My last Hurrah. I needed this album to be the real thing, I had to make it last people for decades. Just in case.”\n<br /><br />\nIn the words of a mother who once stood up giving birth to an artist: \n<br /><br />\n“Dance while you can”, Lykke Li sings.<br />\n“Dance ‘cause you must”.","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/lykke-li","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Lykke Li Zachrisson was born in 1986, the middle child to a photographer mother and a musician father.

But for the first time, I’m not blaming anyone but myself,” Hull says. Produced fat, tactile and beautiful by Dan Hannon, Simple Math is Hannon’s third full-length LP with the band, starting with the debut album I’m Like A Virgin Losing A Child and then the follow-up Mean Everything To Nothing.  Recorded at Blackbird Studios in Nashville and mixed by Joe Chiccarelli, the band kept the same studio set-up and production team intact from their second to third records.\n<br /><br />\nSimple Math is a concept album.  As Roy Shuker defines in his book Popular Music: The Key Concepts, a concept album is a record \"unified by a theme, which can be instrumental, compositional, narrative, or lyrical.\"  Simple Math is indeed unified by all of these. The instrumentation is big, even in its smallest moments.  The composition is emotional and complex, expertly weaving music with story.  The narrative is a trip through a man’s brain, through his mistakes, regrets and realizations.  And the lyrics, which take us firsthand through this life-changing experience, are poetic and raw, honest and passionate.  \n<br /><br />\nBut Manchester Orchestra has always been about truth; about passion.  It’s why Alternative Press gave MO’s 2009 acclaimed Mean Everything to Nothing (which yielded the Top 10 Modern Rock hit “I’ve Got Friends”) a five-star lead review that called the album “a masterpiece of intricacy and honesty.”  You can feel their passion in the power of Hull’s voice and the fury of the band’s music in every track they’ve ever laid down, a power that wraps itself around you and demands your attention as Hull’s lyrics guide you through the world as he sees it. “I’ve always had a clear perception of right and wrong around me,” says Hull, “I’ve constantly questioned my beliefs, trying to find the truth.”  \n<br /><br />\nThe son and grandson of southern ministers, Hull formed Manchester Orchestra in 2004 at the age of 17 with his lifelong friends (Jonathan Corley on bass, keyboardist Chris Freeman, guitarist Robert McDowell and drummer Tim Very) and used their music as a way to explore the issues that mattered most to him, issues of life, emotional vulnerability and the human condition. “I’ve always believed in God, but modernized Christianity can scare me.  I’m a spiritual, but not a religious, person. And I like to use my music to explore how that faith stretches and challenges me to be a better man.”\n<br /><br />\nIn 2005, before they were even old enough to vote, Manchester Orchestra headed out on the road and played over 200 shows, quickly building a legion of loyal fans that grows bigger and bigger with every show they play and every album they release. “We wouldn’t showcase for the record labels,” says Hull of the band’s early days.  “We wanted to play as many gigs as we could and we wanted the labels to come see us live, with our audience, in the clubs.”  And the labels came. In 2007, their explosive first record I’m Like a Virgin Losing A Child became a critical favorite, the New York Times praising it as “Music to swoon to.” Two years later, Mean Everything to Nothing arrived and was heralded as one of the best records of 2009, with Absolute Punk raving: “Quick note to the rest of the albums coming out this year: The bar has just been set.” And now with the arrival of Simple Math, the bar has been set yet again. “The songs on this record are stories,” explains Hull, “but more directed and personal. In many ways, it can be called a dueling conversation between my wife, God and myself.”\n<br /><br />\nThe opening track “Deer” sets a simmering and descriptive starting-point to Hull’s and our journey.  It begins with an honest confession, carefully full of vivid detail.  The lyric I’d go out in public if nobody ever asked perfectly sums up just how hard it is to lead a normal life once your pain becomes public. This is followed by the hard driving and rich Mighty, which Hull describes as sounding “like the Apocalypse.  It’s my darkest hour, in a sense.” The third track, Pensacola, is a meditation on where the band has taken him and where he thinks he may be heading.  “In this song, the innocence is leaving,” says Hull. The raw and masterful April Fool is next, an exquisite dynamite blast of big guitars, giant drums and soaring harmonies that, ironically, “was my first attempt at a love song on this album.” This moves directly into Pale Black Eye, a power-chord powder keg that builds from controlled discourse (“The song is sung three ways: Me to God, me to my wife, and God to me”) to earthshaking confession, a rock and roll bloodletting.

To all of these issues, the same lyric applies: It’s never gonna be the same.” It’s here that the heartfelt and elegant title track (and first single) Simple Math arrives.  “This is a song about an affair, non-existent but unrealized. I cannot hide from the truth. It finds me.  The chorus is myself questioning God.  Had I convinced myself, my family, my band that something is real when it isn’t?” Leave It Alone next slips quietly (at first) into the aftermath, a beautiful yet angry recounting of a three-hour argument brought on by what five years on the road can do to someone.  “I love the last line, If we end up alone, a plague on my head and a curse on our home.  This song is my realization that there’s a chance no one will ever love me like my wife Amy.”\n<br /><br />\nSecond from last is Apprehension, a sobering, lyrical tour through the guilt, the blame, the questioning of who’s at fault. “Not only is the song about Amy and me, it’s also about several friends and family members going through a miscarriage.  It represents that even after all has been mended in one heavy situation, life will continue to give you trials that require immense trust and faith in someone or something.” And ending it all is Leaky Brakes, which tiptoes quietly but confidently in to lead us back into the present.  “The final breath is essentially to admit to everything I’ve ever done wrong,” says Hull of this final track.  “The lyrics are so evolved compared to where we began.  It’s all here and ready to be confronted.  It’s up to me now.”\n<br /><br />\nRarely does an album come along of such monumental honesty and vulnerability. The power of the music, the complexity of the songwriting, the opportunity to hear a band at the top of their game evolving before our very eyes – it all makes Simple Math so much more than a collection of songs, so much more than just a concept album.  Simple Math is a deeply emotional experience.  And, simply put, it is a masterwork.","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/manchester-orchestra","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"On April 1st, 2009, Andy Hull started to put his life back together.\n<br /><br />\nManchester Orchestra’s new album, Simple Math, is about that experience. “It’s the reaction to my marital, physical, and mental failures. But for the first time, I’m not blaming anyone but myself,” Hull says. Produced fat, tactile and beautiful by Dan Hannon, Simple Math is Hannon’s third full-length LP with the band, starting with the debut album I’m Like A Virgin Losing A Child and then the follow-up Mean Everything To Nothing.  Recorded at Blackbird Studios in Nashville and mixed by Joe Chiccarelli, the band kept the same studio set-up and production team intact from their second to third records.\n<br /><br />\nSimple Math is a concept album.  As Roy Shuker defines in his book Popular Music: The Key Concepts, a concept album is a record \"unified by a theme, which can be instrumental, compositional, narrative, or lyrical.\"  Simple Math is indeed unified by all of these. The instrumentation is big, even in its smallest moments.  The composition is emotional and complex, expertly weaving music with story.  The narrative is a trip through a man’s brain, through his mistakes, regrets and realizations.  And the lyrics, which take us firsthand through this life-changing experience, are poetic and raw, honest and passionate.  \n<br /><br />\nBut Manchester Orchestra has always been about truth; about passion.  It’s why Alternative Press gave MO’s 2009 acclaimed Mean Everything to Nothing (which yielded the Top 10 Modern Rock hit “I’ve Got Friends”) a five-star lead review that called the album “a masterpiece of intricacy and honesty.”  You can feel their passion in the power of Hull’s voice and the fury of the band’s music in every track they’ve ever laid down, a power that wraps itself around you and demands your attention as Hull’s lyrics guide you through the world as he sees it. “I’ve always had a clear perception of right and wrong around me,” says Hull, “I’ve constantly questioned my beliefs, trying to find the truth.”  \n<br /><br />\nThe son and grandson of southern ministers, Hull formed Manchester Orchestra in 2004 at the age of 17 with his lifelong friends (Jonathan Corley on bass, keyboardist Chris Freeman, guitarist Robert McDowell and drummer Tim Very) and used their music as a way to explore the issues that mattered most to him, issues of life, emotional vulnerability and the human condition. “I’ve always believed in God, but modernized Christianity can scare me.  I’m a spiritual, but not a religious, person. And I like to use my music to explore how that faith stretches and challenges me to be a better man.”\n<br /><br />\nIn 2005, before they were even old enough to vote, Manchester Orchestra headed out on the road and played over 200 shows, quickly building a legion of loyal fans that grows bigger and bigger with every show they play and every album they release. “We wouldn’t showcase for the record labels,” says Hull of the band’s early days.  “We wanted to play as many gigs as we could and we wanted the labels to come see us live, with our audience, in the clubs.”  And the labels came. In 2007, their explosive first record I’m Like a Virgin Losing A Child became a critical favorite, the New York Times praising it as “Music to swoon to.” Two years later, Mean Everything to Nothing arrived and was heralded as one of the best records of 2009, with Absolute Punk raving: “Quick note to the rest of the albums coming out this year: The bar has just been set.” And now with the arrival of Simple Math, the bar has been set yet again. “The songs on this record are stories,” explains Hull, “but more directed and personal. In many ways, it can be called a dueling conversation between my wife, God and myself.”\n<br /><br />\nThe opening track “Deer” sets a simmering and descriptive starting-point to Hull’s and our journey.  It begins with an honest confession, carefully full of vivid detail.  The lyric I’d go out in public if nobody ever asked perfectly sums up just how hard it is to lead a normal life once your pain becomes public. This is followed by the hard driving and rich Mighty, which Hull describes as sounding “like the Apocalypse.  It’s my darkest hour, in a sense.” The third track, Pensacola, is a meditation on where the band has taken him and where he thinks he may be heading.  “In this song, the innocence is leaving,” says Hull. The raw and masterful April Fool is next, an exquisite dynamite blast of big guitars, giant drums and soaring harmonies that, ironically, “was my first attempt at a love song on this album.” This moves directly into Pale Black Eye, a power-chord powder keg that builds from controlled discourse (“The song is sung three ways: Me to God, me to my wife, and God to me”) to earthshaking confession, a rock and roll bloodletting.

Though You and Me and The Mountain incorporated\nmore acoustic instruments into the mix, Perch Patchwork finds Maps & Atlases\nfilling their newfound space with strings, horns, assorted percussion, and a\nvariety of toy instruments. From the opening trifecta of “Will”, “The Charm” and\n“Living Decorations” to the almost Soweto feel of “Pigeon,” and the gorgeous,\nswelling arrangement of the title track, Maps & Atlases have jettisoned much of\nthe tautness of their previous work in order to let their songs breathe more\ndeeply.\n<br /><br />\nThis new atmosphere was due in no small part to the band’s decision to bring in\nproducer Jason Cupp, whose credits include The Elected, Nurses and Cast Spells.\nWith Cupp’s help Maps & Atlases began to deconstruct and rebuild its songs --\nin some cases changing the original arrangements completely. Cupp also wasn’t\nafraid to get his hands dirty. For example, Cupp lightly punched singer /\nguitarist Dave Davison in the back while he was singing “The Charm” in order\nto achieve a more rhythmic vocal effect.\n<br /><br />\n“Jason is such a pro,” enthuses Davison. “We recorded the previous EPs so fast\nand so… live compared to this record. I definitely learned a lot. It’s really\ninteresting to have different sounds on different parts of the song. It’s not just\nlike ‘Okay. This is the drum sound. Sounds cool. This is the sound of the whole\nrecord.’”\n<br /><br />\nIn this case, the drums were recorded in the B-room at Steve Albini’s studio,\nElectrical Audio, in Chicago. The rest of Perch Patchwork was tracked both in\nthe band’s practice space and at Davison’s parents’ basement in Indiana. In fact,\ndue to its comfort factor, Maps & Atlases do a lot of recording in that basement.\nSays Davison, “I like to take breaks. I’m gonna drink coffee and eat and go for a\nwalk. There are no real distractions. It’s just all part of hanging out and making a\nrecord.” That and they get a great vocal sound in the bathroom.\n<br /><br />\nDavison, Shiraz Dada (bass), Chris Hainey (drums), and Erin Elders (guitar) all\nmet as students at Columbia College in Chicago.

On both,\nMaps & Atlases honed a sound that combined the tightly wound technical\nproficiency of Don Caballero and Hella but with songwriting, arrangements, and\nharmonies that aimed for sky rather than gut. At times the music conjured metal,\njazz, and 8-bit videogame soundtracks spinning blissfully wild-eyed and out of\ncontrol -- sometimes all at once.

However, lest we get carried away by the bombast cliche that is all too easy to pin to this band, there are again moments of delicate, slight beauty. Evidence 'I Belong To You' where Bellamy sings \"I traveled half the world just to say I belong to you...\" Matt continues: \"'Undisclosed Desires' is the first song we've written where I don't play guitar or piano.\" Furthermore, it is an unlikely setting for slap bass courtesy of Chris Wolstenholme, \"But on that song it just seemed to work, so we kept it in,\" he declares.\n<br><br>\nIt is perhaps in the content of Matt's lyrics that 'The Resistance' joins up the dots with the previous two albums.

And that makes a lot of sense for this album… I hate the phrase ‘going back to our roots’, but for this record we came home and made it in Kentucky. And it just felt a lot like it did when we were first starting out...”My Morning Jacket formed at the tail-end of the 1990s, when Jim James’ group Month Of Sundays folded, and he began recording new songs with ex-members of local rockers Winter Death Club. At Above The Cadillac Studios – in reality, a shed on the grounds of guitarist Johnny Quaid’s grandparents’ farm – the group took shape, drawing upon their rich knowledge of classic rock, country, soul and psychedelia, and spinning these influences into fresh, life-affirming rock’n’roll and aching, haunting balladry.\n<br /><br />\nMy Morning Jacket made their early reputation off the three sublime albums they recorded at Above The Cadillac – 1999’s The Tennessee Fire, 2001’s At Dawn and 2003’s It Still Moves – and legendary live shows that proved here was a truly magical group for the ages. It Still Moves marked a move to the major labels for the group, while its heavy touring cycle prompted the amicable exit of Quaid and keyboardist Danny Cash from the ranks.\n<br /><br />\nAlbum number four, 2004’s Z, was a brave step outside of the group’s comfort zone, recorded in New York’s Catskill Mountains with the aid of respected producer John Leckie (Stone Roses, Spriritualised), and with new members guitarist Carl Broemel and keyboard player Bo Koster making their debut appearances on tape, their skilful performances swiftly proving themselves cut from the same cloth as their bandmates. The album also saw James stretch his song-writing chops beyond the familiar reference points of My Morning Jacket’s earlier work, an impulse he furthered with 2008’s Evil Urges, which scattered the group’s ragged rockers and tender, keening ballads with subtly sensual grooves and tracks that sounded like heavy metal laced with psychedelic soul and feral funk.\n<br /><br />\nBoth albums helped grow ever-swelling following, a grass-roots movement that’s spread like wildfire in the wake of their many long and glorious tours, and already-legendary shows like their 4-hour 2008 Bonnaroo head-lining performance, which captured one of the world’s greatest rock’n’roll groups at their most masterful and alive.&nbsp;Circuital is the first album the group have made in Kentucky since It Still Moves, recording it in the gymnasium of a Louisville church under the aegis of producer Tucker Martine. Jim bonded with Martine while recording backing vocals for Laura Veirs’ 2010 album July Flame, which Martine, Veirs’ husband, also produced. “We hit it off right away,” says Martine, who later helped set up a home studio in James’ Louisville home, where he’s working on a future solo album.\n<br /><br />\n“As a group, we’ve always been hoping to find ‘our guy’,” says James. “And we’ve worked with some great people, but we’d wanted to find someone who was, like, ‘one of us’. And Tucker fit in perfectly, and he had a whole set of skills we didn’t possess. He’s real smart, and fun to be with.”&nbsp;Converting the gymnasium into a recording studio wasn’t an easy task, says Martine, but the extra effort yielded unique results. “It’s a big project, to record in a space like that. It has so many limitations, compared to working in a modern studio, but they were limitations we were all drawn to. The focus became on communicating and interacting, and not on what modern trickery we could use later.”\n<br /><br />\nAt the group’s insistence, the album was recorded live, with few overdubs; James’ vocals were recorded at the same time as the band’s performances. “We were going for full takes; we wanted everybody running back to the control room afterwards, freaking out and wanting to listen back to the take,” remembers James. “We’re A Band, and so I want our records to be made that way, with us being A Band. Capturing performances, that intangible thing between us, some kind of soul. When friends have been through as much as we have together… It’s not something I could even describe. We wanted to capture the sound of us just playing, being in the same place and just feeding off each other.”\n<br /><br />\n“This is truly a great band, and they play so well together, it would be wrong not to document that,” adds Martine. For James, the new album finds a sweet understanding between the questing creative impulses of Evil Urges and the more familiar feel of My Morning Jacket’s earlier work. “The album’s like a rolling, gentle soundwave,” he says, in comparison to Evil Urges’ jagged edges. “But I don’t feel Circuital sounds like our earlier recordings. We’re always trying to go in new directions.”&nbsp;His memories of the sessions for Circuital are only fond. “There was no AC, no-one had their laptops. We recorded everything on tape. It was like, we’re just who we are, with what we have with us at the moment, and that’s all we have. It was a beautiful thing, and it really cemented what we all mean to each other, as people and as a band. We’ve learned, slowly over the years, how to function more healthily, I guess, so we don’t all combust. Making this record, it felt like our friendship was only strengthened.”","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/my-morning-jacket","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"“The new record, Circuital, is named after the title song,” explains Jim James, of My Morning Jacket’s sixth studio album. “On that song I sing about ending up in the same place where you started out. And that makes a lot of sense for this album… I hate the phrase ‘going back to our roots’, but for this record we came home and made it in Kentucky. And it just felt a lot like it did when we were first starting out...”My Morning Jacket formed at the tail-end of the 1990s, when Jim James’ group Month Of Sundays folded, and he began recording new songs with ex-members of local rockers Winter Death Club.

Holed up in a synagogue in East London, he had little to begin with — a few fragments, a sketch for a 10-minute song that resembled Street Hassle, and a set of lyrics begun on a New Year's Day train from Wales to London. But what little there was seemed to suggest the beginnings of something quite special, something markedly different to the songs they had written before.\n<br /><br />\nThe continued maturation of Noah and the Whale has been a pleasing thing to follow — from the joyous burst of their debut, Peaceful, the World Lays Me Down, through the lovelorn sobriety of The First Days of Spring, it now reaches a kind of fruition on Last Night on Earth.\n<br /><br />\nWhere The First Days of Spring was a contained and inward-looking record that moved at near-underwater speed, Last Night on Earth possesses a curiosity and a vibrancy, a romance and a restlessness, and a clutch of songs that mark out Fink as not just as one of the best songwriters of his generation, but also as a supremely gifted storyteller. These are tales of youth and ageing, of optimism and running away, as well of failure and pride. “And it feels like his new life can start,” runs the chorus of No Distance Is Too Far. “And it feels like heaven.”\n<br /><br />\nThe album's strong narrative thread was in part inspired by Lou Reed's 1973 album Berlin as well as Tom Waits' 1992 record Bone Machine, and a little Arthur Russell thrown in for good measure. “Just people songs,” is how Fink describes it. “These are simple stories, so you could tell them in hundreds of different ways, and the way you tell them, that's sort of the music.”\n<br /><br />\nThe way he tells them is at times broad-skied and anthemic — particularly on tracks such as L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N and Tonight's The Kind Of Night, while at others there are strokes of unabashed pop — Life Is Life, for example, or Just Me Before We Met. And at others still, such as on final track Old Joy, there is a sweet kind of wistfulness. Lyrically, they range from the nostalgic to the vital, songs charged with an urgency, a sense of movement, and an appetite for adventure and the unknown. It is, in many senses, a true coming of age record.\n<br /><br />\n“I don't think that coming of age thing has been in anything I've done before,” Fink says. “But from the beginning I wanted to write a record that had that excitement of being young and being in the night. I think it's that naivity — that feeling that things are happening everywhere except where you are, wondering what's out there in the wide world. It's when you're on a bus, you don't know where you're heading, you don't know what's at the end of it, and you have this fantasy that whatever's at the end of it is going to be remarkable and magnificent.”\n<br /><br />\nCertainly Noah and the Whale as a band now seem to have come of age. As the leaders of the same British folk-rock scene that spawned Laura Marling, Mumford & Sons, and Emmy the Great, with this album they appear to stand perhaps a little taller and a little broader than their peers; these songs possess a maturity, and a new kind of wisdom: “Tall buildings and a wife won't be enough for me,” Fink sings on Old Joy. “There is more in the world to be found than dreams.”\n<br /><br />\nThe personnel shifted a little for Last Night on Earth. Drummer Doug Fink left the band last year to concentrate on his medical career. “He's my older brother, and there's so many roles he fulfils on the road, not just the drummer, so it's kind of hard,” Fink says of his absence. “But he's the first person I go to if I need to consult someone, if I need someone's opinion, so he's still been a big part of this record … And I think he will come back eventually.”\n<br /><br />\nCo-produced by Fink and Jason Lader [Julian Casablancas, The Mars Volta] in Los Angeles, Last Night on Earth features backing vocals by Jen Turner from Here We Go Magic, and gospel vocals by the legendary Waters Sisters, who famously provided backing vocals for Michael Jackson's Wanna Be Starting Something. “I was teaching them the vocals for Old Joy,” Fink recalls. “One of the sisters came in and asked for a latte with six sugars – six sugars! — and she downed that, went in and gave the best vocal take I've ever heard.”  Elsewhere, the record features Adam MacDougall of The Black Crowes on Moog and Rhodes, and legendary percussionist Lenny Castro.\n<br /><br />\nThere is a strong cinematic element to Last Night on Earth — from the deliberately Twin Peaks air of Wild Thing to the album's cast of richly-drawn characters. In part this was fed by Fink's experience of directing the short film that accompanied The First Days of Spring. “Film is such a different writing process, it infiltrates the way I write songs,” he explains. “And a lot of them I imagined as scenes — Tonight's the Kind of Night I imagined as this guy running away from home and getting on a bus…”\n<br /><br />\nIt is also a richly poetic record: last year, Fink read the work of Frank O'Hara for the first time, and fell in love with his poem Having A Coke With You. “I wanted Life Is Life to have a feel of that, or a tempo. Just the notion of it. Having A Coke With You is I think a very romantic poem, and that's the only outwardly romantic song on the album, and so I wanted it to have the same approach.”\n<br /><br />\nThe album's title is also a nod towards Charles Bukowski's poetry collection The Last Night of the Earth — Fink says he was attracted to the sense of “loser's pride” in Bukowski's work. “In my head,” he says, “there is a link between Lou Reed's Berlin, and Bukowski's poetry.” The track Life Is Life, is another Bukowski reference, its title tipping its hat to his poem The Laughing Heart — a poem whose final lines seem to sum up this record quite perfectly: “Your life is your life,” it runs. “Know it while you have it. You are marvellous. The Gods wait to delight in you.”","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/noah-the-whale","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"In the early January of last year, Charlie Fink set to work on Noah and the Whale's third album.

You probably know the bit about the treadmills by now (if not, you can read Ira Glass’s account below), but one can authoritatively say that those trusty treadmills shot the band into both better health and a technicolor zone beyond the hoary indie-versus-major debate.\n<br /><br />\nBillboard called them “trailblazing,” the head of Apple’s marketing said they were “the first post-internet band, the first band to use the internet as a medium of art, not just commerce.” BusinessWeek praised their new model of “proactive creative types… looking beyond traditional parameters to get support for their work.” OK Go’s project is one of the modern age, of unlimited possibility, where infectious songs, inventive videos, surprising live shows, and an articulate, forward-thinking back-end combine into a total work by a defiantly do-it-yourself band without a shoestring budget. The band says they just like “making stuff.”\n<br /><br />\nIn a series of surprising partnerships, companies like State Farm, Samsung, Flip Camera, and Range Rover have stepped into the role that major labels once occupied: investing in the band’s berserker videos (like the 18-million-views-and-growing /UK-MVA-Best-Rock-Video-winning Rube Goldberg-esque masterpiece for “This Too Shall Pass”) and sold-out tours. Moreover, the band have emerged with an unprecedented level of independence, simultaneously bypassing a dying industry’s gate-keepers with creative aplomb and forging the kind of three-dimensional band/audience relationship only fantasized about by social networking consultants.\n<br /><br />\nThe band’s very public dispute with EMI about fans’ rights to embed the band’s videos landed them square in the crosshairs of contemporary culture. Kulash has penned editorials for The Times of London, The New\nYork Times, and The Washington Post. “I’ve heard about nerdy being hip, but I’ve never known that just plain boring can be hip,” Stephen Colbert noted of the deal with the not-known-for-their-non-boringness State Farm, which funded the assuredly not boring “This Too Shall Pass” video. “This is a new level of hipness!” Colbert concluded.\n<br /><br />\nAs befitting any band that recently parted ways with a venerable multinational corporation with their master tapes intact, OK Go also recently launched their own imprint, Paracadute.

You probably know the bit about the treadmills by now (if not, you can read Ira Glass’s account below), but one can authoritatively say that those trusty treadmills shot the band into both better health and a technicolor zone beyond the hoary indie-versus-major debate.\n<br /><br />\nBillboard called them “trailblazing,” the head of Apple’s marketing said they were “the first post-internet band, the first band to use the internet as a medium of art, not just commerce.” BusinessWeek praised their new model of “proactive creative types… looking beyond traditional parameters to get support for their work.” OK Go’s project is one of the modern age, of unlimited possibility, where infectious songs, inventive videos, surprising live shows, and an articulate, forward-thinking back-end combine into a total work by a defiantly do-it-yourself band without a shoestring budget. The band says they just like “making stuff.”\n<br /><br />\nIn a series of surprising partnerships, companies like State Farm, Samsung, Flip Camera, and Range Rover have stepped into the role that major labels once occupied: investing in the band’s berserker videos (like the 18-million-views-and-growing /UK-MVA-Best-Rock-Video-winning Rube Goldberg-esque masterpiece for “This Too Shall Pass”) and sold-out tours. Moreover, the band have emerged with an unprecedented level of independence, simultaneously bypassing a dying industry’s gate-keepers with creative aplomb and forging the kind of three-dimensional band/audience relationship only fantasized about by social networking consultants.\n<br /><br />\nThe band’s very public dispute with EMI about fans’ rights to embed the band’s videos landed them square in the crosshairs of contemporary culture. Kulash has penned editorials for The Times of London, The New\nYork Times, and The Washington Post. “I’ve heard about nerdy being hip, but I’ve never known that just plain boring can be hip,” Stephen Colbert noted of the deal with the not-known-for-their-non-boringness State Farm, which funded the assuredly not boring “This Too Shall Pass” video. “This is a new level of hipness!” Colbert concluded.\n<br /><br />\nAs befitting any band that recently parted ways with a venerable multinational corporation with their master tapes intact, OK Go also recently launched their own imprint, Paracadute. Not surprisingly, there’s a new version of Blue Colour loaded with the expected demos, covers, live jams, and 12-track remix set, but also access to an online database where the band will continue to expand the album, still a breathing, growing entity.\n<br /><br />\nRecorded with longtime Flaming Lips collaborator Dave Fridmann and named for a gorgeously quacky 19th century text, Of the Blue Colour of the Sky is not to be forgotten.

Nay nay nay… Truth be told, there was music played, a little together, mostly with others, there were marriages and spawn, international living situations, crops harvested, things whittled and all that jargon. The “hiatus” was important, like any good breather though, “the time has come”, like that midnight oil tune. Pedals is a potpourri of slaying rockers and feel good jams.

He sat in with many of NYʼs famed hardcore bands of the mid/late 80ʼs, Youth of Today, Warzone, Supertouch, Project X, etc. Schreifels recently released a long awaited solo record, and has been living \nbetween Berlin and NYC.

He was the first father of the four, that is correct, they \nare all Dads of young ladies. Tolman who currently resides in Salt Lake \nCity, was the bassist in Iceburn.  In the early 90ʼs, they were the Mahavishnu \nOrchestra of the Revelation Records hardcore scene.  During the Rival Schools hiatus, Cache was playing with Gavin Rosdale and released an album under the name Institute. He plays a Dan Armstrong clear bass, and is a Leo.

Siegler has released records and toured with many bands, Glassjaw, CIV, Nightmare of You, Youth Of Today and Head Automatica to name a few. He filled in one night only with Patti Smith and got to play Madison Square Garden opening for KISS with the group CIV. He and Schreifels were partners in the independent record label Some Records, and down the road he hopes to open a Led Zeppelin themed restaurant called “You Cooked Me”. \n <br><br>\nOther factoids for the friendly new comer - Please know that the name Rival \nSchools came from the video game Rival Schools United by Fate.

Blockhead who works a lot with Aesop Rock, Daryl Palumbo from Head Automatica, Glassjaw, and Ad Rock from the Beasties all contributed remixes which will find there way to listeners in some appropriate manner.
