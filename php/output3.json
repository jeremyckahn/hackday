For an album entirely recorded in Mr and Mrs Macfarlane’s garage, it made a serious impact, selling over 200,000 copies and picking up a fistful of Brit Award and Mercury nominations along the way. The band’s appeal spanned everyone from indie kids to clubbers to the highest strata of the fashion world – the band were handpicked by Gucci to soundtrack a worldwide campaign, covering Depeche Mode’s Strangelove for an advert created by acclaimed director Frank Miller (Sin City, The Spirit).\n<br /><br />\nMost importantly they have watched their global audience grow exponentially as their live shows become ever more spectacular. Two sold out dates at London’s 2500 capacity Kentish Town Forum found the band transforming a normally rather drab venue into a Brazilian carnival. Friendly Fires’ all-night club events sprang up where the trio would be joined by guests like Hot Chips’ Joe Goddard, Danilo Plessow’s Detroit-centric Motor City Drum Ensemble and Kompakt Records boss, Michael Mayer.\n<br /><br />\nOf course, one day, the touring and the promotion ended and the band realised they had to make a new record, prove themselves all over again. How would they do that?\n<br /><br />\n“We’re not the sort of band who write songs in sound-checks or on the back of the tour bus,” laughs Ed. “You think you’ll be really inspired by touring, all these mad places you visit, but that’s a myth really. Well it is for me. When we came off tour I remember thinking, ‘I hope I can still write songs...’”\n<br /><br />\nSo in October 2009 Friendly Fires began to piece together the ideas and themes that would become their new record, Pala.  They began in a basement studio in Shoreditch called, with admirable candour, The Basement, but London’s ever-present distractions kept them from really focusing, so in January 2010 they moved operations back to their original home, Ed’s parent’s garage in St Alban’s.\n<br /><br />\nAs soon as the band let go and began to work “bizarre hours” Pala began to take shape. The shifting, shuffling Chimes took serious shape, as did the Afro-beat pop explosion of Pull Me Back To Earth. The brilliantly frenetic True Love soon appeared and was, with its slap-bass and shimmery guitars, clearly and immediately, a very Friendly Fires sort of song. “Once we were away from everything we were fine,” Jack says. “Because all we were left with were our ideas.”\n<br /><br />\nAnd what ideas they were. Camera shutters, guitar lines inspired by old Hawaiian records, ancient home-recorded cassettes, bells ringing and bird-song all appeared as endlessly manipulated samples as the songs were, in classic Friendly Fires manner, painstakingly built up piece by piece. \n<br /><br />\nWhen the garage became too crowded Ed took himself off to a rented seafront house in out-of-season Rye to work on melodies and lyrics. “Mine was the only house on the whole street that was occupied,” he says. “I was forced into being creative.”\n<br /><br />\nLast autumn, as Edd and Jack worked on songs, Ed packed up again and drove a van all the way to a converted barn in Yvetot in the far north of Upper Normandy. This would be where the album’s lyrical themes would really develop. \n<br /><br />\n“It was miles from the nearest neighbour,” Ed says. “It was quite scary actually – the place was haunted. No television, no internet, no central heating. I had to get firewood every day. It was very rustic…”\n<br /><br />\nBut the barn’s isolation worked brilliantly. \n<br /><br />\n“It exaggerated all my emotions,” Ed says. “Which is great for songwriting. A lot of the songs on this record are about rejection and loneliness, my own search for what really is true love?”\n<br /><br />\nThree weeks in Ed was getting cabin fever and jumped a train to Rouen. When he got back to he wrote the broken-hearted, disco-scented Running Away, which is all about being afraid of admitting your feelings for someone close to you. It’s still one of his favourites.\n<br /><br />\nThe trick Pala pulls of so wonderfully is making the melancholic sound so euphoric, putting Ed’s worried words up against the brightest, toughest music they’ve ever made. Show Me Lights is spectacular, with a real Hollywood sheen, yet still massively heavy, pure pop. \n<br /><br />\n“I feel nostalgic for that mid-to-late 90s, hip-hop meets chart pop meets RnB sort of music,” Ed says. “I love those N-Sync or Backstreet Boys records, tough hi-tech pop with hugely detailed production. And slamming percussion too. Having said that I probably hated it at the time!” \n<br /><br />\n“But that era of pop music does feel like it had more soul,” Edd nods. “Nowadays you hear the same synth sounds on everything – it all feels soulless and sterile.\n<br /><br />\nEd, Edd and Jack talk with great enthusiasm about Talking Heads, Tom Tom Club, Timbaland and Scritti Politti, artists who made brilliant pop records with a sense of otherness, but also of the genius techno of Carl Craig and Boards of Canada too.\n“It’s those odd chords,” Jack says. “That edge of romance and nostalgia – music with heartbreak but not melodrama.”\n<br /><br />\n“It’s about honesty,” Ed says. “A lot of house and disco music has simplistic lyrics, they’re not trying to be clever, like indie music so often is. That cleverness doesn’t appeal to me – I like dancing to music where someone tells you something real, ‘I need your love!’ That’s a million times better than someone being clever.\n<br /><br />\nThe title track was inspired by Aldous Huxley’s 1962 novel, Island.\n<br /><br />\n“I liked the idea of this utopian society where everyone gets along but it all fails anyway,” laughs Ed. “The idea that paradise is temporary and you must enjoy it while you can really applies to my life – and to most people I know. A doomed utopia is a great symbol for music!”\n<br /><br />\nSo, three years later, Friendly Fires can’t wait to get back into it. They feel 2011 is a great year for the record, after music’s minimalistic wallowing of the last couple of years. The band have now been playing together for half their lives, so another long stint on the road together holds no fears. “We argue and get heated about things, but it’s not an ego war,” laughs Edd. “We can disagree without it becoming a fist fight.”\n<br /><br />\nAnd after amazing shows in New York, Australia and Japan they are ready to take this brilliant new record to the rest of the world.\n<br /><br />\n“It’s daunting,” Ed says. “But we’re ready for it. The truth is, there’s just not enough music out there that’s really celebratory.”","hometown":"St Albans,","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/friendly-fires","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"\"If we had an manifesto for this album\" says Friendly Fires’ singer and bass-player Ed Macfarlane, \"it was a simple one; make an exciting, colourful pop record\"\n<br /><br />\n“Our goal is to make vibrant, widescreen songs” adds guitarist Edd Gibson. “but they must retain a spontaneity, have an energy and mysticism around them.”\n<br /><br />\n“We try really hard to focus on making everything sound as spontaneous and fun and off the cuff as possible,” nods Ed.\n<br /><br />\n“Only we spend months doing it,” deadpans drummer Jack Savidge.\n<br /><br />\nIt has been three years since Friendly Fires released their self-titled debut album.

In my mind, an album shouldn’t be self-titled\nunless it feels that way.”\n<br /><br />\nProduced by Mark Batson (Dr. Dre, Eminem, Jay-Z, Dave Matthews Band), who also cowrote\nsix of the 13 songs with Potter, Grace Potter and the Nocturnals introduces the\nVermont-based band’s new five-piece configuration, in which keyboard specialist Potter,\nlead guitarist Scott Tournet and drummer Matt Burr are joined by bassist Catherine\nPopper (Ryan Adams & the Cardinals, Hem) and rhythm guitarist Benny Yurco, who also\nplays with Tournet and Burr in the GPN side project Blues & Lasers.\n<br /><br />\n“We had a stylistic epiphany,” Potter says of her band’s exponential leap. “We realized\nwe’re not the kind of band that’s ever gonna fit neatly in one genre, and this time we\njust let the songs be the songs. We just naturally wound up playing them in a certain\nway — they all have that beat to them, a physicality and a mood. You have to either\nwant to dance to it or cry to it. But there’s also a feistiness to these songs that’s completely\nunapologetic.”\n<br /><br />\nOn deep-grooved, serrated rockers like “Medicine,” “Paris,” “Tiny Light” and “Oasis,” the\nnew model Grace Potter and the Nocturnals positively swaggers. Not only that, but the\nhooks are humongous, from Potter’s voice as she belts, teases and soars to Tournet’s\nuncoiling guitar riffs, positively lethal in their aggressiveness. “Oasis” showcases the\nband’s newly mounted dual-guitar firepower, as Tournet and Yurco interweave spiraling\nlines over a refracted hip-hop groove deftly laid down by Burr and Popper, while “Tiny\nLight” is a powerful song of resilience and hope during dark times.\n<br /><br />\n“Matt and Scott came up with the music for “Medicine” — the drum roll and that killer\nguitar hook — months before I came up with the lyrics or the vocal melody,” Grace\nexplains. “It gets across the emotion of somebody trying to steal your man away and\nthen fighting for what’s yours, getting back to a place where you’re in control. I picture\nmy adversary as a young Stevie Nicks, but with long black hair, who shows up, woos\neverybody and freaks me out, until I realize there is something I can do — then I step\nup and make my own magic.\n<br /><br />\n“When I wrote “Paris,” I was listening to the Kinks nonstop, and I was going for something\nwith a big, primal riff, like “You Really Got Me.” It was the first time I ever really\njust said, ‘I’m not going to try to tell a story, and I’m not going to try to communicate\nan emotion. I’m just going to say, basically, ‘I want to have sex right now.’” It’s my favorite\nsong to perform. That and “Medicine” are the sexiest, feistiest and the most fun of\nanything we’ve ever done.”\n<br /><br />\nPotter and her cohorts are equally captivating at the other end of the dynamic and\nthematic spectrum, on the zeitgeist-capturing widescreen ballad “Colors.” “I wrote it in\nNovember 2008, right after Obama was elected,” she says, “and there was a tingle in\nthe air. We were in St. Louis, which is a relatively conflicted city in terms of their political\nfeelings. We went to the zoo, and the cab driver on the way there was really angry\nand upset, but the cab driver on the way back to the hotel was listening to people\ntalking about the election on the radio with tears in his eyes. So that to me felt like\na moment in time that really needed to be captured, and I wanted to hold onto that\nmoment forever.”\nThough GPN initially made a name for themselves — and became a self-sufficient touring\nunit — on the jam-band circuit, the group’s sound was deeply rooted in the golden\nage of rock ’n’ roll; they cite Little Feat and J.J. Cale as huge influences early on. Burr\nand Potter formed the earliest version of the Nocturnals while both were students at St.\nLawrence University after he introduced her to the myriad joys of The Last Waltz. So it\nwas that the two soon-to-be bandmates and soulmates formed their bond while in the\nthrall of The Band, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison and Bob Dylan. All in all,\nnot a bad place to start.\n<br /><br />\nBecause of their ready acceptance on the U.S. touring circuit, they were able to regularly\nplay as many as 200 shows a year, shaping and sharpening their sound the\nold-fashioned way, on stages in front of demanding crowds. With the 2009 arrivals of\nPopper and Yurco the Nocturnals are entering the next phase of their evolution.\nThe current lineup came together with downright cosmic serendipity during the spring\nof 2009, when they were asked to cover some songs from the late ’60s for the VH1\ndocumentary Woodstock: Then and Now soon after the departure of their bass player.\nAfter accepting the invitation, Potter, Tournet and Burr went into scramble mode. At the\nsuggestion of a mutual friend, they contacted Popper, who agreed to join them for the\nsession as a one-off. Potter then impetuously threw out the idea that they bring down\nYurco from Vermont to add a second guitar.\n<br /><br />\nAs soon as they plugged in and started playing at New York’s Avatar Studios, blazing\nthrough the Airplane’s “White Rabbit,” Mitchell’s “Woodstock” and Janis Joplin’s “Try,” it\nwas dramatically apparent to all five musicians as well as those gathered in the control\nroom that something special was going on. Popper and Yurco didn’t just fit in, they\ncrushed it. After that beginning, there was no question that this lineup would be permanent.\nIt was as if the fates had insisted they come together.\n<br /><br />\nGrace, Matt and Scott were well aware of the North Carolina-born Popper, having seen\nher in action with Ryan Adams and the Cardinals. “We were just in awe of her the\nentire time,” says Grace. “She was like the hottest thing we’d ever seen.”\n<br /><br />\nLike Burr, Yurco is originally from New Jersey, where he started playing guitar at age\n10. Watching him play Keith Richards to Tournet’s Mick Taylor as the two guitarists work\ntheir way through complex and fiery extended passages onstage, shoulder-length hair\nflopping in front of his face, you soon come to understand the key role he plays in the\nNocturnals. “Joining this group was the greatest moment of my life,” says Yurco. “Gracie\nwrites great songs, Matty is an incredible drummer and Scotty is one of my favorite\nguitarists. I really dig the music, and I couldn’t be happier playing guitar in a band I\nreally appreciate.”\n<br /><br />\nThe band members are quick to credit Batson for enabling them to find themselves.\n“Our producer let us be ourselves and just play music together,” says Tournet. “I think\nwe hindered ourselves in some ways — we took some of the bite out of it on the first\ncouple of records. For whatever reasons we were scared to unleash the full thing…. I\ndon’t think we even realized what the full thing was. We’ve evolved into this monster,\nand Batson pulled the monster out of us.”\n<br /><br />\nWhat Batson has so vividly captured is a group of exceptional young players in the\nvery act of becoming themselves, as Grace puts it, on an album that is likely to surprise\nand delight even the band’s most devoted fans, as well as winning them a legion of\nnew ones. Over seven years and three albums, Grace Potter and the Nocturnals have\ngrown from an uncommonly bright and tasteful baby band into a force of nature, blowing\nthe roof off the sucker with seeming effortlessness. Make no mistake about it — this\nband has arrived.\n<br /><br />\n“Every record you make, you always say, ‘This is the one,’” says Matt. “But with this lineup\nwe’ve cracked the code. To get to this point we had to go through those records. It’s\nbeen a journey; Nothing but the Water was a fantastic time, going into a barn and\ngoing through our Neil Young Harvest/J.J. Cale moment, and This Is Somewhere was\nan incredible learning experience for us. The journey has culminated with this record.\nWe’ve all matured as musicians, and Benny and Catherine have made a huge difference.\nWe have the dream lineup, the dream sound, the dream producer — the whole\nfamily now is officially there.”\n<br /><br />\n“We were a homegrown Vermont band for five years,” says Grace with a wicked smile.\n“Now we’re a national act that does not want to be fucked with.” After pausing for dramatic\n(or comedic) effect, she continues in a more serious vein. “With this record we feel\nlike we’re finally there, after a long struggle. It’s like the song “Oasis,” which is about\nslogging through the desert feeling like you’re completely lost, with no end to the road\nand very little hope. I wrote it as advice to myself to keep on walking, because in the\nmiddle of the desert there might be an oasis. And that’s what we’ve actually found.”","hometown":"Waitsfield, Vermont","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/grace-potter-and-the-nocturnals","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Grace Potter and the Nocturnals are like a modern-day version of\nTina Turner stroking the microphone in a spangled mini-dress while\nfronting the Rolling Stones circa Sticky Fingers.

She is unmistakable both in her music (a fusion of  surf guitars, blues and rockabilly that wouldn’t be out of place in a David Lynch film)  and her style, with a solitary curl and shock of blonde in her jet black hair. In Ireland, her debut album  ‘Love Tattoo’, which she recorded and released on her own label, has gone Triple Platinum. She has shared a stage with Eric Clapton, Chuck Berry, David Gilmour, Sharon Shannon, Jeff Beck, Shane Macgowan, Kirsty McCall, Van Morrison, Lionel Richie, Wanda Jackson, Paul Brady and Meatloaf. And now, with the release of her new album “Mayhem”, she is about to go stellar.\n<br /><br />\nBeing the youngest of five siblings , Imelda was the most susceptible to the various influences from her older brothers and sisters, which she could hear constantly through the walls of their two bedroom house. There was folk, the obligatory chart pop, and then there was Elvis. “My brother was a mad Elvis fan, and I found a tape in his room with Elvis, Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent. I thought the music was fantastic.”\n<br /><br />\nBy the age of nine Imelda had fallen in love with rockabilly and the blues – the only kid in her class who wasn’t into Wet Wet Wet.  Singing along to rock n roll from an early age, her tastes began to develop and deepen, first with Elmore James and then – “ I heard Billie Holiday, and that blew my mind.”   After a year of art college she dropped out, deciding she would rather sing for a living.  At that point, her professional experience was confined to having sung on an ad for Findus Fish Fingers at 14.  “A girl in The Liberties was in the music business and she got me this ad, where I sang, ‘Betcha never put your finger on a crunchier crumb!’  I got £40 for it!” She quickly found work singing with the swing troupe Blue Harlem and rock n roller Mike Sanchez and had an interesting spell of singing in burlesque clubs: “I’d sing while the other girls were onstage.  One of them used to take an angle grinder to her crotch and would produce a shower of sparks.  One day a spark flew down my throat when I was singing!”\n<br /><br />\nImelda began singing in clubs when she was 16 years old and had the honour of being  occasionally barred from her own shows at Dublin’s Bruxelles club for being underage.  “I was getting tips from the best musicians in Dublin.  One of them said, ‘Your voice is great, but it needs to roughen.” It was around this time, when driving a tearful Imelda to a gig, that her father asked her “Is your heart broken? Excellent. Now you can sing the blues”.  Remembered by Imelda as a turning point in her life, from then on her voice developed into the sultry, rich and unique tone you hear today.\n<br /><br />\nBy 2006 she was itching to go solo, and formed her own band.  “We started out a bit jazzier, but it needed balls and roughing up which it got.”  Her debut album, “Love Tattoo” was soon released and started to get noticed. Catching the attention of Jools Holland in 2008 she supported him on tour which led to him requesting her to appear on Later.  Here she performed to an audience that included Jeff Beck, Elbow and Roots Manuva and afterwards Beck made a point of telling Holland that he was only there to see Imelda.  In 2009, Imelda knocked Bruce Springsteen off No. 1 to become the first female Irish artist to top the Irish album charts since Mary Black nearly 20 years ago. She  then went on to win Female Artist of the Year at the Irish Meteor Awards. Despite album success, Imelda continued to tour, playing to over 400 000 people in 8 countries across Europe and the US – including, most recently a US tour with Jamie Cullum.\n<br /><br />\nImelda has not only caught people’s attention musically, her striking style and unmistakable cool but quirky 50s look has led her to grace the front cover of the Irish Sunday Times Style, Roberto Cavalli flew her out to perform at his  private party during the Milan Fashion Week.\n<br /><br />\n2010  got off to an auspicious start when Imelda accepted an offer from Jeff Beck to perform with him at the Grammys. This was followed in April by a two night support slot in London with one of her idols, Wanda Jackson.\n<br /><br />\nHer new album ‘Mayhem’ sees Imelda continue to develop her uniquely modern fusion of classic musical genres.   The record not only showcases her exceptional songwriting ability, but also displays some  more disparate influences, with first single Psycho seeing Imelda channel the spirit of early PJ Harvey, whilst the heartbreakingly poignant “Kentish Town Waltz” conjures an image of Chrissie Hynde at her most reflective.\n<br /><br />\nThis year Imelda will perform at Glastonbury, T In The Park, Womad and Ireland’s Electric Picnic as well as touring the UK in May asnd September. She also has three songs – including the legendary “Johnny Gotta  Boom Boom”  and forthcoming single “Mayhem” featuring on the soundtrack to the new “Wild Target” film starring Bill Nighy, Emily Blunt and Rupert Everett.\n<br /><br />\nImelda May?

Weird? Maybe, but consider it practice for the place Scott \"Kid Cudi\" Mescudi finds himself now. The rapper from Cleveland quit a restaurant job in his hometown of Shaker Heights after his boss encouraged him to leave Ohio and carve his lane in the entertainment industry. By then, Cudi was already rapping on the local circuit, and when he decided to drop out of college after his freshman year, he moved to New York City on October 7, 2004. In his pocket? A demo tape and $500 cash.\n<br /><br />\nNYC was a new beginning for Cudi. A loner in a city where he didn't know anyone, Cudi would walk aimlessly through Times Square and go to the movies by himself. His uncle, the last sibling of Cudi’s father who died of cancer when he was 11, allowed him to stay in his South Bronx apartment. Cudi slept on a couch while juggling retail jobs at stores like American Apparel and A Bathing Ape and clocking long hours at the recording studio every night with his managers Plain Pat and Emile. (In 2008, Cudi and his partners started the indie label Dream On.) Cudi fell into the typical MC grind until tragedy struck in 2006: His uncle suffered the same fate as Cudi’s father and passed away. Cudi went back to Cleveland for the funeral in a emotional funk which inspired \"Day N Nite\"—the song that would change his life forever. Recorded in a pitch-black room, Cudi put his heart into the gloomy pop-hit. After posting it on his MySpace, the song started racking up hits and eventually caught the attention of A-Trak, Kanye West's former tour DJ. \n<br /><br />\nA-Trak fell in love with song, and Cudi ended up signing a single deal on the DJ’s \"Fool's Gold\" label. A critically-acclaimed mixtape, presented by Pat and Emile and co-branded with NYC streetwear label 10 Deep called \"A KiD Named CuDi\" was the MC's  first full body of work, and released on July 17, 2008 . Things were looking up, but the game truly changed when A-Trak played \"Day N Nite\" at Kanye West's \"Stronger\" premiere party. West loved the song,and saw enough potential in Cudi that he flew him out to Hawaii to do reference hooks for Jay-Z's The Blueprint 3. Soon, ‘Ye and Cudi started work on Kanye's 808s & Heartbreak album. Cudi's sing-songy, eclectic style was the perfect match for 808s, and the up-and-comer ended up writing four songs (“Heartless,” “Paranoid,” “Welcome To Heartbreak,” and “Robocop”). Before long, the kid from Cleveland was beginning to creep into the mainstream. With hype (and Kanye) behind him and a Billboard hit with \"Day N Nite,\" Cudi inked a deal with Kanye's G.O.O.D music label. Soon after, he parlayed that into a major deal with Universal Motown.  \n<br /><br />\nOn September 15, 2009, Kid Cudi released his debut album Man On The Moon: The End Of Day, a genre-bending concept album that took people through Scott Mescudi's dreams, nightmares, and unique views of the world.  The album—which featured production from Emile, Plain Pat, RATATAT, MGMT and Kanye West—sold 104,419 copies its first week, good enough for #4 on the Billboard chart. The album's reception, both critical and commercial, proved Universal Motown President Sylvia Rhone's assertion that Cudi was a  \"game-changer in hip-hop\". \n<br /><br />\nAnd a game-changer he has been. As the stats go for Cudder, to date he's sold over 4.6 million digital singles, 1.3 million mobiletones, and according to The Hype Machine, he is among the top ten most blogged about artists of all-time. As of August 2010, Cudi's videos on VEVO clock in at over 32 million views. In addition to being sought-after for his music, top-tier companies like Converse and Heineken have tapped Kid Cudi to appear in campaigns like \"3 Artists, 1 Song\" and \"Plug into Summer,\" respectively, while Askmen.com has labeled him a \"Style Icon.\"\n<br /><br />\nAfter his debut album dropped, Cudi set off on a sold-out city-to-city tour with Asher Roth (\"The Great Hangover Tour\") and appeared as the main attraction at festivals like Audiotistic and Bonnaroo, all while prepping his sophomore album, Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager.  The highly-anticipated album, set to release November 9, will feature Kanye West, Mary J. Blige and GLC, with production from Emile, Plain Pat, Jim Jonsin, Diplo, Dot Da Genius and others. Its first single, \"Erase Me,\" debuted at #22 on Billboard's Hot 100 when it released on iTunes this past August.  Cudi promises that the album will be darker than its first, and will build on the cinematic theme that he prides his music on. There's no question that the album will be well-received by critics and fans alike, so the only question that remains is: where will you be for the revolution?","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/kid-cudi","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"He used to make funny faces in the mirror and rap to himself growing up.

Soon, ‘Ye and Cudi started work on Kanye's 808s & Heartbreak album. Cudi's sing-songy, eclectic style was the perfect match for 808s, and the up-and-comer ended up writing four songs (“Heartless,” “Paranoid,” “Welcome To Heartbreak,” and “Robocop”). Before long, the kid from Cleveland was beginning to creep into the mainstream. With hype (and Kanye) behind him and a Billboard hit with \"Day N Nite,\" Cudi inked a deal with Kanye's G.O.O.D music label. Soon after, he parlayed that into a major deal with Universal Motown.  \n<br /><br />\nOn September 15, 2009, Kid Cudi released his debut album Man On The Moon: The End Of Day, a genre-bending concept album that took people through Scott Mescudi's dreams, nightmares, and unique views of the world.  The album—which featured production from Emile, Plain Pat, RATATAT, MGMT and Kanye West—sold 104,419 copies its first week, good enough for #4 on the Billboard chart. The album's reception, both critical and commercial, proved Universal Motown President Sylvia Rhone's assertion that Cudi was a  \"game-changer in hip-hop\". \n<br /><br />\nAnd a game-changer he has been. As the stats go for Cudder, to date he's sold over 4.6 million digital singles, 1.3 million mobiletones, and according to The Hype Machine, he is among the top ten most blogged about artists of all-time. As of August 2010, Cudi's videos on VEVO clock in at over 32 million views. In addition to being sought-after for his music, top-tier companies like Converse and Heineken have tapped Kid Cudi to appear in campaigns like \"3 Artists, 1 Song\" and \"Plug into Summer,\" respectively, while Askmen.com has labeled him a \"Style Icon.\"\n<br /><br />\nAfter his debut album dropped, Cudi set off on a sold-out city-to-city tour with Asher Roth (\"The Great Hangover Tour\") and appeared as the main attraction at festivals like Audiotistic and Bonnaroo, all while prepping his sophomore album, Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager.  The highly-anticipated album, set to release November 9, will feature Kanye West, Mary J. Blige and GLC, with production from Emile, Plain Pat, Jim Jonsin, Diplo, Dot Da Genius and others. Its first single, \"Erase Me,\" debuted at #22 on Billboard's Hot 100 when it released on iTunes this past August.  Cudi promises that the album will be darker than its first, and will build on the cinematic theme that he prides his music on. There's no question that the album will be well-received by critics and fans alike, so the only question that remains is: where will you be for the revolution?","musicbrainz_id":null},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14969/sq_90.JPG","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14969/original.JPG","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/61332.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"88","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"5"}},"main_lineup_position":"4300","twitter_username":"kidsthesedays","setlist":null,"title":"Kids These Days","updated_at":"2011-05-05 19:44:57 -0500","youtube_id":"mriAvnEctro","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/62129.json","title":"Foster The People"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/125413.json","title":"Black Cards"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/135801.json","title":"Patrick Stump"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/103753.json","title":"The Kingston Springs"}]},"flickr_tag":"kidsthesedays","id":"61332","echonest_id":"AR7V8LD1187FB3E8A5","homepage":"http://www.facebook.com/kidsthesedaysband","myspace_link":"http://www.myspace.com/kidsthesedaysband","fan_count":"599","description":"The members who make up Chicago-bred band Kids These Days hail from\nevery corner of the music spectrum and varying neighborhoods of\nChicago, but their collective sound creates a hybrid genre influenced by\nequal parts jazz, funk, blues, soul and hip-hop.

It’s the city that inspired Rock Island Line and that bore Bix Beiderbecke; it’s the stuff of spring floods and pick-up trucks and bona fide blue-collar country music.   She’s a straight-talking Midwestern girl, all flaxen hair and big blue eyes, and this girl is smart and gutsy and tough, with a big old voice to match it: Laurel Canyon prettiness stewed in campfire and bourbon.\n<br><br>\nLissie was always musical. Inspired by her Grandfather, a former international barbershop quartet champion, she would sing along at her Lutheran church but she was never a choirgirl. She scored the lead in an 80-date production of Annie for the local dinner theatre at the age of nine. “I was always humming,” she says, “making up these little songs and melodies, writing these poems and putting them to music. I know if I’m feeling bummed out just the vibration of singing is kind of soothing to me.”\n<br><br>\nShe was also the family rebel.  Trouble seemed to have a knack for following Lissie, from once dyeing her hair with pen ink in 6th grade to cutting class, talking back, eventually getting thrown out of high school. “I felt that people didn’t know what to do with me, and tried to squash my spirit a little, which gave rise to a defiant streak within me early on,” she self-describes. “It was that that made me bend my ideas around convention.” She taught herself a handful of guitar chords, wrote about the girls who snubbed her and the boys who broke her and all the scrapes she got herself into. Playing them out loud at the local coffee shop where she worked, she dreamed of the world beyond her hometown.\n<br><br>\nColorado State University was sort of a back-up plan, a brief toe-dip into academia. She played music, honing her songs, headlining the local theatre, writing and recording a track with a local electronic DJ that found its way onto TV, soundtracking The OC, Veronica Mars, and House. She spent a semester in Paris, kept writing, kept playing, and then ditched college altogether when she returned to the US, moving to Los Angeles to make a go of her music career.\n<br><br>\nIn LA she played bars, showcases and residencies, sometimes performing in clubs to an audience of one. In the spring of 2006, she started a weekly residency with musician friends at Crane’s Hollywood Tavern in her neighborhood, which she named ‘Beachwood Rockers’ Society’.  Lissie made ends meet handing out restaurant flyers and selling honey every Sunday at the local farmer’s market. “Raw honey,” she recalls. “I would say, ‘Have you tried the world’s best-tasting honey? It’s not heated, treated, whipped or spun!’”\n<br><br>\nLittle by little, things came together.  She recorded a five-track EP, Why You Runnin’, with her friend Bill Reynolds (of Band of Horses) and in London with Ed Harcourt, which Fat Possum released in November 2009. The EP caught the attention of new fans and the U.S. press, with praise rolling in from Paste, Nylon, Filter, and Marie Claire, among others. She toured with Ray LaMontagne, A.A. Bondy, City &amp; Colour, and The Low Anthem; she eventually tackled a whirlwind SXSW schedule (10 shows, 4 days) with ease and won over tough critics like Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, and even Perez Hilton.\n<br><br>\nShe headed to Nashville to record with Jacquire King (who was fresh from working with the Kings of Leon), and also recorded some more with Reynolds. What came out of these sessions is the bulk of her debut album, Catching A Tiger: 12 songs that range from bluesy-folk to unfettered pop, and showcase both her remarkable voice and her songwriting chops.\n<br><br>\nLissie left LA, spent time in London and Tennessee, hankering a little for that midwestern hometown in Illinois. Eventually she extricated herself from a long, troubled relationship and relocated to Ojai, CA, population just shy of 8,000.  She rented an old farmhouse she had never seen, in a town she had never visited, “just because I sat next to someone from there on an airplane who told me it was nice.” She likes it up there. “It’s fairly slow, everything closes early and you can see all the stars at night. There are mountains outside my front door and it’s really quiet, which means I get a lot of work done and have time to myself, which is essential for me to function. I can still drive into LA for some excitement when I want, going out and being around other people is equally important to me.”\n<br><br>\n“All these things,” she says, talking a little about her new hometown in CA, and a little about her music, too, “I do them without thinking. So much of my process is instinct and it’s natural. Even in photo shoots I won’t wear concealer, I don’t want to look like someone painted my face.  Everything I do I want to feel natural; I want it to mean something to me.  If it doesn’t feel natural I can’t do it. I can’t act. I’m not good at faking it.”\n<br><br>\nAnd this is the essence of Lissie, something straight-down-the-line, unaffected. “Now I’ve gotten older I really found myself recognizing the hometown Midwesterner in me and embracing it,” she says. “For better or worse it may not be all that tactful or that cool, but there’s no phoniness. It’s pretty direct. And I’m direct; I’m not hiding anything. I don’t really know what or why or who I am,” she says, “but I don’t know how to not be how I am.” Lissie is, you might say, ‘not heated, treated, whipped or spun.’\n<br><br>\nSince early this year, Lissie has largely been based in London, where Catching A Tiger was first released.  Embraced lovingly by the British press, she’s been featured in Q, The Sun, The Sunday Times, The Mirror, Time Out, The Big Issue, and on the BBC and Later…with Jools Holland, among others; she’s played with Joshua Radin, Local Natives, and Alan Pownall, in addition to performing at Bonnaroo in Manchester, TN, and The Great Escape in Brighton, England.  She’s also picked up praise and support from a wide range of fellow artists, including Katy Perry, Courtney Love, Mumford &amp; Sons, and Ellie Goulding, who joined her onstage to perform “Everywhere I Go” at The Great Escape in May.","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/lissie","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Lissie was born in Rock Island, Illinois, one of the Quad Cities on the banks of the Mississippi River.

The EP caught the attention of new fans and the U.S. press, with praise rolling in from Paste, Nylon, Filter, and Marie Claire, among others. She toured with Ray LaMontagne, A.A. Bondy, City &amp; Colour, and The Low Anthem; she eventually tackled a whirlwind SXSW schedule (10 shows, 4 days) with ease and won over tough critics like Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, and even Perez Hilton.\n<br><br>\nShe headed to Nashville to record with Jacquire King (who was fresh from working with the Kings of Leon), and also recorded some more with Reynolds. What came out of these sessions is the bulk of her debut album, Catching A Tiger: 12 songs that range from bluesy-folk to unfettered pop, and showcase both her remarkable voice and her songwriting chops.\n<br><br>\nLissie left LA, spent time in London and Tennessee, hankering a little for that midwestern hometown in Illinois. Eventually she extricated herself from a long, troubled relationship and relocated to Ojai, CA, population just shy of 8,000.  She rented an old farmhouse she had never seen, in a town she had never visited, “just because I sat next to someone from there on an airplane who told me it was nice.” She likes it up there. “It’s fairly slow, everything closes early and you can see all the stars at night. There are mountains outside my front door and it’s really quiet, which means I get a lot of work done and have time to myself, which is essential for me to function. I can still drive into LA for some excitement when I want, going out and being around other people is equally important to me.”\n<br><br>\n“All these things,” she says, talking a little about her new hometown in CA, and a little about her music, too, “I do them without thinking. So much of my process is instinct and it’s natural. Even in photo shoots I won’t wear concealer, I don’t want to look like someone painted my face.  Everything I do I want to feel natural; I want it to mean something to me.  If it doesn’t feel natural I can’t do it. I can’t act. I’m not good at faking it.”\n<br><br>\nAnd this is the essence of Lissie, something straight-down-the-line, unaffected. “Now I’ve gotten older I really found myself recognizing the hometown Midwesterner in me and embracing it,” she says. “For better or worse it may not be all that tactful or that cool, but there’s no phoniness. It’s pretty direct. And I’m direct; I’m not hiding anything. I don’t really know what or why or who I am,” she says, “but I don’t know how to not be how I am.” Lissie is, you might say, ‘not heated, treated, whipped or spun.’\n<br><br>\nSince early this year, Lissie has largely been based in London, where Catching A Tiger was first released.  Embraced lovingly by the British press, she’s been featured in Q, The Sun, The Sunday Times, The Mirror, Time Out, The Big Issue, and on the BBC and Later…with Jools Holland, among others; she’s played with Joshua Radin, Local Natives, and Alan Pownall, in addition to performing at Bonnaroo in Manchester, TN, and The Great Escape in Brighton, England.  She’s also picked up praise and support from a wide range of fellow artists, including Katy Perry, Courtney Love, Mumford &amp; Sons, and Ellie Goulding, who joined her onstage to perform “Everywhere I Go” at The Great Escape in May.","musicbrainz_id":null},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14889/sq_90.jpg","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14889/original.jpg","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/49854.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"27","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"4"}},"main_lineup_position":"1350","twitter_username":"LOCALNATIVES","setlist":null,"title":"Local Natives","updated_at":"2011-05-05 19:44:57 -0500","youtube_id":"UB6dxqGDMkc","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/57971.json","title":"The Drums"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/60621.json","title":"Sleigh Bells"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/122072.json","title":"Boy & Bear"}]},"flickr_tag":"localnatives","id":"49854","echonest_id":"ARAWGDQ11FF10D8556","homepage":"http://www.thelocalnatives.com/","myspace_link":null,"fan_count":"4292","description":"Local Natives make soaring, sky-scraping harmonies, dreamy orchestral\nmelodies, and throbbing tribal beats that bash their way into your soul.\nTheirs are songs you can dance to almost as well as you can swoon to\nthem.
