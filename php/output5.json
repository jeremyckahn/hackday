For Ryan\nBingham, who took home the Academy Award for “The Weary Kind,” his hauntingly\nbeautiful theme song for the acclaimed Crazy Heart, it instead represented a crossroads\nand a decision about which path to take.\n<br /><br />\n“When there are a lot of people around saying ‘look, you have to capitalize on this\nand do something really commercial,’ you might think about it for a second,” admits the\nLA-based singer-songwriter. “But at the end of the day, there’s not a chance in hell I\ncould do that. It made me sick to my stomach just thinking about it. I couldn’t get up in\nfront of people and play a bunch of stuff that didn’t mean anything to me.”\nBingham puts that philosophy to the test in a big way on Junky Star, his third\nalbum on Lost Highway, which was recorded in a matter of days with producer T Bone\nBurnett, his collaborator on the Crazy Heart soundtrack. The disc delivers a bracing\nfusion of pensive, gravelly ballads - like “Hallelujah,” which is not a Leonard Cohen\ncover, but his own take on mortality, delivered from the other side of the veil - and raw,\nrock‘n’roll cuts that showcase Bingham’s incisive, darkly compelling lyrical bent.\n<br /><br />\nBingham channels a number of unique spirits over the course of the album,\nleading with his sensitive side on “The Poet” and kicking out the jams on the Waylonmeets-\nKeith Richards “All Choked Up Again.” Elsewhere, as in songs like “Depression”\n- a vivid evocation of our current social climate that’d have Woody Guthrie nodding in\napproval - and the album’s poignant title track, Bingham applies his wizened rasp with\nprecise strokes, wringing emotion from every note.\n<br /><br />\n“I’ve always been passionate about the situation of homeless people and kids\nhaving to survive on the streets, so some of these songs come from that, from looking at\nwhat people need to do to survive,” he explains. “So Junky Star doesn’t have anything to\ndo with drugs or anything like that, it’s more about finding the beauty in what might at\nfirst appear to be rough around the edges. You can see that beauty in someone on the\nstreet, like some guy just raving and be like ‘I wonder what this guy has been through to\nget to that place?’”\n<br /><br />\nThe same might be said for Bingham himself. Born in New Mexico and raised all\nacross the Southwest, he set out on his own at a young age, shuffling from town to town\nlooking for a place to sleep between rodeos, day labor, and a weekly gig at a no-frills\nlocal bar.\n<br /><br />\nThat spirit infused Bingham’s Lost Highway debut, Mescalito, which won kudos\nfrom media outlets as varied as Rolling Stone, Esquire and The Washington Post - the\nlatter noted “anyone seeking to invent a modern-day Texas troubadour couldn’t do better\nthan to replicate Ryan Bingham’s life story.” Indeed, the disc opened many illuminating\nwindows into the soul of a man who, despite still being in his twenties, had already done\nplenty of living.\n<br /><br />\nThose experiences served Bingham well, earning him more critical acclaim for\n2008’s Roadhouse Sun, a disc that prompted Billboard to defer comparisons to forebears\nand note “Bingham's not a \"new\" anything: He's his own man, and a singular talent at\nthat.” That’s high praise indeed, but the opinion was shared by plenty of the singersongwriter’s\nmusical peers, including T Bone Burnett, who he collaborated with on the\nsoundtrack for Crazy Heart.","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/ryan-bingham-the-dead-horses","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"For some artists, winning an Oscar would represent reaching a pinnacle.

Released January 18th on Fat Possum Records, Dye it Blonde retains the charm of their debut but without the same financial shackles the result is a beautifully clean high quality recording of lushly layered pop songs.","musicbrainz_id":null},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14931/sq_90.JPG","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14931/original.JPG","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/108160.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"11","location":"Lineup - Perrys","tier":"4"}},"main_lineup_position":"5500","twitter_username":"supermashbros","setlist":null,"title":"Super Mash Bros.","updated_at":"2011-05-05 19:44:57 -0500","youtube_id":"JdR557TvOLM","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/32495.json","title":"Girl Talk"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/44130.json","title":"Pretty Lights"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/91557.json","title":"Sam Adams"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/43316.json","title":"Jay Electronica"}]},"flickr_tag":"supermashbros","id":"108160","echonest_id":"ARIYGNN123526A0571","homepage":"http://supermashbros.com/","myspace_link":"http://www.myspace.com/sprmshbros","fan_count":"3340","description":"Mash-Up Artists, DJ’s, Computer Musicians, Video Artists, call them what you will.

Retooling innovative art rock, sleek New Wave, and punchy power pop in their own idiosyncratic image, The Cars’ groundbreaking sonic approach continues to influence artists and airwaves today.  Singer/guitarist Ric Ocasek emerged as a master songwriter with his enigmatic integration of evocative, beat-inspired lyricism with radio-friendly hooks and harmonies, fueling a multi-platinum body of work that includes such indisputable masterpieces as 1978’s self-titled debut and 1984’s blockbuster Heartbeat City.  \n<br /><br />\nMove Like This reveals The Cars to be as creatively progressive as ever.  Songs like “Blue Tip” and “Free” are invigorating and imaginatively wrought, with all the trademark elements in place, from Ocasek’s sardonic, man-machine vocalizing and Greg Hawkes’ swirling synths to Elliot Easton’s turbo-charged riffing and David Robinson’s pop-motorik beats.  Brimming with confidence and imaginative energy, Move Like This boasts all the vitality and dynamism of a truly great rock ‘n’ roll band operating at the peak of their considerable power. \n<br /><br />\nThe project’s genesis came in the fall of 2009 as Ocasek considered how to proceed with his latest sheaf of songs, his first batch of material since 2005’s solo Nexterday.  As he debated how to record – On his own?  With a new group of musicians? – he realized that his best option was the three players with whom he had the most symbiotic relationship.\n<br /><br />\n“I just thought, it’s been a long time since I played with these guys,” Ocasek says, “but they’re the ones that will do the best job.  They’re the ones that I wouldn’t have to explain things to, they wouldn’t have to get used to the way I write, they’re already inundated with all that.  I’ll just put out a feeler and see if they’d be interested in doing it.”\n<br /><br />\nHe reached out to Hawkes, Easton, and Robinson, each of whom were excited at the opportunity to play together again.  In October, The Cars convened for rehearsals in bucolic Millbrook, New York, working at both Millbrook Sound Studios and Ocasek’s home Broken Beak Studio. After a few days of what Ocasek describes as “brushing off the cobwebs,” songs quickly began taking shape, including  “Free,” “Blue Tip,” “Drag On Forever,” and “Too Late”.\n<br /><br />\n“The simplicity of us getting together and making a record was amazing to me,” says Robinson.  “When you’ve got the right combination of people, you can just start back up again.”\n<br /><br />\nAll four agreed from the start that there was no replacing the late bassist/co-lead singer Ben Orr, who passed away in 2000.  Hawkes took on the bass duties. \n<br /><br />\n“I felt it most when it became a reality that we were going to make a record as the four of us,” Ocasek says.  “It was like, ‘Oh, I guess I’m going to have to sing them all.’”\n<br /><br />\nThough the original plan was to self-record with no goal greater than releasing the results online, The Cars were so energized by the rehearsals that they decided to team up with an outside producer, someone who would allow the band to simply be a band while also adding a new perspective to the proceedings.  \n<br /><br />\nOcasek contacted Garret “Jacknife” Lee, whom he admired for his work with such bands as Weezer, The Hives, and Snow Patrol.  An avowed Cars fan, the producer was thrilled at the opportunity to work with the band, who headed to Los Angeles’ Village Recorders for two weeks of sessions.  Ocasek credits Lee as a “phenomenal” collaborator, arranger, and musician. \n<br /><br />\n“He was just perfect for this record,” Ocasek says.  “He had stupendous ideas, he was technically on top of everything.  He earns the name ‘Jacknife’ because he’s so quick.  He knew right away if something worked or not.”\n<br /><br />\nWhile lesser bands would’ve been content to simply coast on pastiche, The Cars’ determined focus all along was how best to put a contemporary spin on their timeless sound.  From the swaggering fizz of “Too Late” and “It’s Only” to the lithesome melodicism of “Soon” and “Take Another Look,” Move Like This succeeds in spades, pulling off the uncanny trick of sounding simultaneously classic and emphatically up to date.\n<br /><br />\nThe album’s lyrical content is equally contemporaneous, with songs such as “Sad Song” and “Blue Tip” born from Ocasek’s interest in how media influences the way people think. The songwriter sees the album as a significant progression from his remarkable catalog.\n<br /><br />\n“I always used to say you write the same song all the time,” Ocasek says, “but I felt these songs were somewhat different from what I usually do. I felt the lyrics were more topical, a bit more poetic.”\n<br /><br />\nImbued with irrefutable energy and a lifetime of artistry, Move Like This marks a model addition to The Cars’ continuum, their exuberant electro-powered pop having long since become the very quintessence of modern rock ‘n’ roll.\n<br /><br />\n“It seems like The Cars are one of those bands that generations which follow seem to discover,” Easton says.  \n<br /><br />\n“I’m always surprised and moved when I hear other musicians say how they’ve been influenced by The Cars,” says Hawkes of the band’s legacy. “I’m very grateful for that.”\n<br /><br />\nHaving come together solely for the purpose of making Move Like This, the band is now considering their next step.  Live shows are on the horizon, though there’s little interest in hitting the road for a cash-in reunion tour.  No matter what happens, Ocasek reckons the world has not heard the last of The Cars.","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/the-cars","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Move Like This, The Cars’ first album of new music in many years, is a vibrant and ingenious collection that expertly extends their already extraordinary canon.

Brimming with confidence and imaginative energy, Move Like This boasts all the vitality and dynamism of a truly great rock ‘n’ roll band operating at the peak of their considerable power. \n<br /><br />\nThe project’s genesis came in the fall of 2009 as Ocasek considered how to proceed with his latest sheaf of songs, his first batch of material since 2005’s solo Nexterday.  As he debated how to record – On his own?  With a new group of musicians? – he realized that his best option was the three players with whom he had the most symbiotic relationship.\n<br /><br />\n“I just thought, it’s been a long time since I played with these guys,” Ocasek says, “but they’re the ones that will do the best job.  They’re the ones that I wouldn’t have to explain things to, they wouldn’t have to get used to the way I write, they’re already inundated with all that.  I’ll just put out a feeler and see if they’d be interested in doing it.”\n<br /><br />\nHe reached out to Hawkes, Easton, and Robinson, each of whom were excited at the opportunity to play together again.  In October, The Cars convened for rehearsals in bucolic Millbrook, New York, working at both Millbrook Sound Studios and Ocasek’s home Broken Beak Studio. After a few days of what Ocasek describes as “brushing off the cobwebs,” songs quickly began taking shape, including  “Free,” “Blue Tip,” “Drag On Forever,” and “Too Late”.\n<br /><br />\n“The simplicity of us getting together and making a record was amazing to me,” says Robinson.  “When you’ve got the right combination of people, you can just start back up again.”\n<br /><br />\nAll four agreed from the start that there was no replacing the late bassist/co-lead singer Ben Orr, who passed away in 2000.  Hawkes took on the bass duties. \n<br /><br />\n“I felt it most when it became a reality that we were going to make a record as the four of us,” Ocasek says.  “It was like, ‘Oh, I guess I’m going to have to sing them all.’”\n<br /><br />\nThough the original plan was to self-record with no goal greater than releasing the results online, The Cars were so energized by the rehearsals that they decided to team up with an outside producer, someone who would allow the band to simply be a band while also adding a new perspective to the proceedings.  \n<br /><br />\nOcasek contacted Garret “Jacknife” Lee, whom he admired for his work with such bands as Weezer, The Hives, and Snow Patrol.  An avowed Cars fan, the producer was thrilled at the opportunity to work with the band, who headed to Los Angeles’ Village Recorders for two weeks of sessions.  Ocasek credits Lee as a “phenomenal” collaborator, arranger, and musician. \n<br /><br />\n“He was just perfect for this record,” Ocasek says.  “He had stupendous ideas, he was technically on top of everything.  He earns the name ‘Jacknife’ because he’s so quick.  He knew right away if something worked or not.”\n<br /><br />\nWhile lesser bands would’ve been content to simply coast on pastiche, The Cars’ determined focus all along was how best to put a contemporary spin on their timeless sound.  From the swaggering fizz of “Too Late” and “It’s Only” to the lithesome melodicism of “Soon” and “Take Another Look,” Move Like This succeeds in spades, pulling off the uncanny trick of sounding simultaneously classic and emphatically up to date.\n<br /><br />\nThe album’s lyrical content is equally contemporaneous, with songs such as “Sad Song” and “Blue Tip” born from Ocasek’s interest in how media influences the way people think. The songwriter sees the album as a significant progression from his remarkable catalog.\n<br /><br />\n“I always used to say you write the same song all the time,” Ocasek says, “but I felt these songs were somewhat different from what I usually do. I felt the lyrics were more topical, a bit more poetic.”\n<br /><br />\nImbued with irrefutable energy and a lifetime of artistry, Move Like This marks a model addition to The Cars’ continuum, their exuberant electro-powered pop having long since become the very quintessence of modern rock ‘n’ roll.\n<br /><br />\n“It seems like The Cars are one of those bands that generations which follow seem to discover,” Easton says.  \n<br /><br />\n“I’m always surprised and moved when I hear other musicians say how they’ve been influenced by The Cars,” says Hawkes of the band’s legacy. “I’m very grateful for that.”\n<br /><br />\nHaving come together solely for the purpose of making Move Like This, the band is now considering their next step.  Live shows are on the horizon, though there’s little interest in hitting the road for a cash-in reunion tour.  No matter what happens, Ocasek reckons the world has not heard the last of The Cars.","musicbrainz_id":null},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14972/sq_90.jpg","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14972/original.jpg","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/46842.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"92","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"5"}},"main_lineup_position":"4550","twitter_username":"tcgo1974","setlist":null,"title":"The Chain Gang of 1974","updated_at":"2011-05-05 19:44:57 -0500","youtube_id":"VAaFHBLX-Gs","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/95619.json","title":"The Naked and Famous"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/83866.json","title":"DALE EARNHARDT JR.

Growing up as an only child, the singer immersed herself in her parents' enormous record collection and the classical guitar studies she took on at the age of seven. \"I loved playing guitar by myself, back then I was quite introverted with my music,\" she says.\n<br /><br />\nBryan and Dafydd had been writing music separately from one another, and worked together in a couple of short-lived local bands after finishing school. They knew they wanted to collaborate, but didn't manage to make it work until a few years ago. \"We kept missing each other,\" Ritzy says. Bryan went off to Washington, D.C \"on a whim\" and returned to Wales in 2008 with renewed focus. \"My family situation wasn't easy to go back to\" says Bryan. \"I came back out of necessity and found a lot of sanctuary recording with Rhydian and having this new band to concentrate on.\"\n<br /><br />\nFor six months, the pair wrote together, experimenting with different sonic approaches. \"We'd go for walks in the hills between recordings,\" Dafydd remembers. \"We'd write for hours and hours,\" adds Bryan, \"and if we got frustrated, we'd go stomp it out, up and down the mountains.\" But as the sessions began yielding signature tunes like \"Austere\" and \"Cradle\" - tracks that combined the duo's interest in thick, textured noises with clear, shimmering pop hooks - they knew they'd found their sound. \"We'd always been into writing strong melodies,\" Bryan says. \"The sparks really flew when we started messing with things that were choral and symphonic, mixed with what both of us had already enjoyed separately: dirty, loud, rhythmic guitars and thick bass-lines.\"\n<br /><br />\nThe Joy Formidable released \"Austere\" in July 2008, followed by \"Cradle\" on double 7\" later that summer, and quickly produced an eight-track EP, A Balloon Called Moaning, which they released themselves in the U.K. in early 2009. Having relocated to London and recruited drummer Matthew Thomas, the trio quickly earned a reputation for blistering live performances. \"We love and encourage the beautiful double-pedal,\" says Bryan, with a chuckle. \"We do lean towards a slightly metal aesthetic when it comes to drums, which makes it very loud and heavy and all the things we want to be as a live entity. The new album definitely explores those elements, and that's because of Matt being in the band.\"\n<br /><br />\nThe trio spent 2009 touring the U.K., Europe and Australia with bands including Editors, Temper Trap and Passion Pit, mastering tiny clubs and festival stages alike. Their introduction to American audiences came early this year, when Passion Pit invited The Joy Formidable to open a pair of sold-out shows at New York's Terminal 5. In late April, they teamed with a new label started by Passion Pit's Ayad Al Adhamy, Black Bell Records, to release A Balloon Called Moaning in the U.S. The New York Times' Jon Pareles praised the EP's \"cryptic lyrics that glint with urgency,\" and said that \"the music regenerates the turbulent haze of 1990s rock, but it's less tormented and more anthemic, confident of the pop structures at its core.\" They've also earned critical raves from NME, The Guardian, the London Times, Spin and Pitchfork, heavy rotation on Sirius XM's indie rock channel, Sirius XMU, and praise from Garbage's Shirley Manson and Courtney Love, among others. This summer, The Joy Formidable signed with Canvasback/Atlantic Records, and will release their debut album for the label, The Big Roar, early next year. \n<br /><br />\nWhen they weren't on the road, the band worked on writing and tracking the material for The Big Roar. \"We recorded in a tiny corner of our London bedroom\" Bryan says. \"It was great, because you could capture that moment when you wake up in the middle of the night with a melody or an image or a lyric.\" Working on and off for a year, The Joy Formidable crafted a remarkable collection of modern rock songs that explore what Bryan describes as \"the possibility of victory in a hopeless situation.” Adds Dafydd: \"The album covers a lot of emotional range. It's captured the battle between the eternal optimist and the manic depressive.\"\n<br /><br />\nThey produced The Big Roar themselves - with help from engineer Neak Menter - and traveled to Los Angeles this summer to mix it with producer Rich Costey (Muse, Foo Fighters, Glasvegas). A single from those sessions, \"I Don't Want To See You Like This,\" is due out this autumn, with the full-length to follow in early 2011.\n<br /><br />\nThe Joy Formidable will headline the Emerge NME Radar tour in September and October, making stops at various venues throughout the UK, and return to the U.S. for a headlining run in November.","hometown":"Wales ","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/the-joy-formidable","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"There's something panoramic about The Joy Formidable's music - their mountainous, fuzzed out riffs and ferocious, earthy rhythms shrouded in ethereal haze.

In late April, they teamed with a new label started by Passion Pit's Ayad Al Adhamy, Black Bell Records, to release A Balloon Called Moaning in the U.S. The New York Times' Jon Pareles praised the EP's \"cryptic lyrics that glint with urgency,\" and said that \"the music regenerates the turbulent haze of 1990s rock, but it's less tormented and more anthemic, confident of the pop structures at its core.\" They've also earned critical raves from NME, The Guardian, the London Times, Spin and Pitchfork, heavy rotation on Sirius XM's indie rock channel, Sirius XMU, and praise from Garbage's Shirley Manson and Courtney Love, among others. This summer, The Joy Formidable signed with Canvasback/Atlantic Records, and will release their debut album for the label, The Big Roar, early next year. \n<br /><br />\nWhen they weren't on the road, the band worked on writing and tracking the material for The Big Roar. \"We recorded in a tiny corner of our London bedroom\" Bryan says. \"It was great, because you could capture that moment when you wake up in the middle of the night with a melody or an image or a lyric.\" Working on and off for a year, The Joy Formidable crafted a remarkable collection of modern rock songs that explore what Bryan describes as \"the possibility of victory in a hopeless situation.” Adds Dafydd: \"The album covers a lot of emotional range. It's captured the battle between the eternal optimist and the manic depressive.\"\n<br /><br />\nThey produced The Big Roar themselves - with help from engineer Neak Menter - and traveled to Los Angeles this summer to mix it with producer Rich Costey (Muse, Foo Fighters, Glasvegas). A single from those sessions, \"I Don't Want To See You Like This,\" is due out this autumn, with the full-length to follow in early 2011.\n<br /><br />\nThe Joy Formidable will headline the Emerge NME Radar tour in September and October, making stops at various venues throughout the UK, and return to the U.S. for a headlining run in November.","musicbrainz_id":null},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14890/sq_90.JPG","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14890/original.JPG","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/40203.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"28","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"4"}},"main_lineup_position":"1400","twitter_username":null,"setlist":null,"title":"The Kills","updated_at":"2011-05-05 19:44:58 -0500","youtube_id":"hniPVDz12bc","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/197512.json","title":"Black Lips"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/32433.json","title":"Flogging Molly"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/17296.json","title":"Lykke Li"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/7292.json","title":"Cold War Kids"}]},"flickr_tag":"thekills","id":"40203","echonest_id":"ARBLDRW1187B9A05A1","homepage":"http://www.thekills.tv/index.php","myspace_link":"http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=10451833","fan_count":"3993","description":"Dreamy and feverish, hooky and repetitive, obsessive and claustrophobic – that’s The Kills’ fourth album, “Blood Pressures”. ‘Obsessive and claustro-phobic?’ repeats Jamie Hince: ‘yes, I like that. After we’d made the record, Alison and I talked about the theme: there’s a lot about gender, about rela-tionships; it’s about sex – so, blood pressures’.\n<br /><br />\n‘Right now, I would say it's quite a dark record,’ says Alison Mosshart; ‘the lyr-ics are a little twisted.  I think I always say that about every record I do.  I think we're just both obsessive people. Obsessive about what we love and maybe even more obsessive about what we hate. I need to perform this record live to see what it really is, and what it's really communicating’.\n <br /><br />\nIn contrast to 2008’s “Midnight Boom”, the new album is a return to the band’s trademark dark guitar rock but with a twist. ‘The music’s changed be-cause Alison was on tour with The Dead Weather for much of last year,’ Jamie continues. ‘It was really freeing to take ideas of hers and to change them musi-cally. “The Last Goodbye” for instance changes from 4/4 to waltz time’. \n<br /><br />\n‘The Dead Weather is a very different kind of band,’ Alison agrees. ‘For one, it's a 4 piece band with a lot going on, and it's pretty spontaneous. I wasn't used to not knowing what was going to happen next on stage, having been so familiar performing with a drum machine. So I think I got better at using my voice as an instrument to make sounds and noise that could compete with gui-tars and feedback, rather than just delivering lyrics’.  \n<br /><br />\n“Blood Pressures” was recorded at Key Club Studios in Benton Harbor, Michi-gan. Jamie: ‘it was an absolute second home, with no distractions. I delved into sampling and programming. I spent a lot of time with drum kits. When we were recording the album, I visited a school band room: have you ever been to a band room in the US? They are absolutely huge, with walls of vari-ous kinds of drums. I sampled them all’.\n<br /><br />\n‘Programming the drums was really tedious to start with. If I wasn’t a control freak, I wouldn’t do it. But if I get started on something, I will obsess about it. I really like the techno feel. I really like all my emotions to come out in the gui-tar playing and it’s even better against a really rigid backbeat where there’s no speeding up or slowing down. I like that tension and I like the possibilities of where the drums can go’.\n<br /><br />\nThe sound of “Blood Pressures” is both technological and elemental: hypnotic, repetitive structures are augmented by C21 studio techniques, psychedelic touches and passionate vocals from Alison and Jamie. One song– “Nail In My Coffin” – features an early 70’s mellotron-style keyboard called an Optigan, from which the bass drum sound is sampled on much of the album: ‘it’s de-signed to sound like strings,’ says Jamie; ‘I just put these wind noises through a very vintage tape echo from 1965’.\n<br /><br />\nThe Kills’ working relationship is that of a real collaboration, with Alison and Jamie trading lyric lines, vocal parts – as on opener “Future Starts Slow” – as well as beats and melodies. ‘I’ve been in loads of bands and done my share of thinking too much about it,’ says Jamie. ‘But it’s better to free yourself up. Alison really helps me with that. I would definitely gravitate towards things taking too long, but she forces me to be more spontaneous’.\n\n‘Some days I think we're twins’ says Alison. ‘Some days I think we aren't simi-lar at all. We came together because we 'liked' the same things. We had so much in common on an art and music level. We are both quite impatient. We are both quite excitable, but Jamie is a perfectionist. He won't stop something until it's just the way he imagined it. I'm not like that. I love the moment, the snap shot, the accident. Oh, and I'm American, and he's English... so there's that’.  \n<br /><br />\nThis working relationship is exemplified by the two songs in the heart of the album, the exquisite ballad “Wild Charms” – sung by Jamie – and the brood-ing “DNA”, sung by Alison – both of which have the image of fire burning each other out. ‘Sometimes you sit down to write something and something else comes out. The two songs complement each other: “Wild Charms” is written from one point of view and “DNA” from another,’ says Alison. \n<br /><br />\n‘We've always written songs apart with the occasional song from start to finish together’ Alison says. ‘I suppose what I do is write melody and lyrics on an acoustic guitar, and then the songs like this that Jamie likes, he takes and transforms, gives them real music and form. With his own songs, he works them out from start to finish. He's quite tormented by his songs I think. I usu-ally don't hear them for awhile. He's very secretive. I try and help him with lyrics but often it's only a couple of missing lines I do’. \n<br /><br />\n‘The lyrics for “DNA” are Jamie's. The second he finished the last line, I was singing it in the studio. I think it was the last night of recording the album ac-tually. I love that song so much. “The Last Goodbye” is my lyrics: that song came out really quick.  It was one of those really natural songs to write that seemed to come out of nowhere. Jamie heard it and decided it would be best on an Optigan. He made it really special’. \n<br /><br />\nAlison’s lyrics are a revelation throughout, echoing old blues tropes and then taking them somewhere else. ‘How can I rely on my heart,’ she sings on “The Last Goodbye”, ‘if I break it with my own two hands’. Here defiant assertion quickly shades into brutal self-examination and candid admissions: ‘I am no better at this than you are’ (“Nail In My Coffin”).\n<br /><br />\n‘The blues are definitely an inspiration,’ she agrees: ‘I feel like every piece of music that I really love, and that really speaks to me is blues or has been in-spired by the blues somehow. I never get tired of the blues. I never feel dis-connected from the blues.\n<br /><br />\n‘Alison’s really prolific with lyrics, she’s got reels and reels of them,’ says Ja-mie. And she’s rooted in that type of music. ‘That’s the sound she likes. I came to it late. She’s still finding something new in the blues, and working with Jack White made it even more exciting for her. After “Midnight Boom” I was slightly frustrated and it’s a perfect antidote to racing round, thinking about trying to reproduce Compass Point and Grace Jones’.\n<br /><br />\nThis sense of continuity is fused with a thoroughly contemporary approach. Along with the techno flourishes – at the start of first single “Satellite” for in-stance – Jamie’s guitar sound has been heavily treated: ‘the guitar parts do sound quite processed. I used seven amps in different rooms, all with different frequencies, trying to get that brutal sound. I used octave pedals and very old gear – and it sounds a bit more futuristic’.\n<br /><br />\nAmong the artists that Jamie currently cites as an inspiration are Link Wray, Little Milton (‘the start of R&B’), Dave Bartholomew (Fats Domino’s arran-ger/ producer) and Captain Beefheart (‘he blew my mind when I was a teen-ager: I was gutted to hear the news when he died’). ‘And I’ve been listening to reggae: I got into it from Grace Jones, Sly and Robbie, and Peter Tosh. It was the last bastion of music that I hadn’t really delved into’.  Jamie’s love of reg-gae is clearly heard in the mutated rhythms of the album’s first single “Satel-lite”.\n<br /><br />\nAlthough very well-connected, The Kills are determined to pursue their own vision: as Jamie says about recording at Key Club in Michigan, with its lack of distractions, ‘That isolation was just great. You get absolutely high off playing music all days long. Being unaware of what’s going on in the rest of the world – I just love that’. \n<br /><br />\nAnd it is this uncompromising quality that has brought them testimonials from young groups.  Jamie’s reaction: ‘The XX citing us an influence. They want to meet US? That to me is quite phenomenal. We’ve given up quite a lot to do it our way. Some of our things work, others don’t. But there’s not too many bands that have that feeling, unfolding their music over six or seven al-bums. And there’s not that many labels who would support that.’","hometown":"London UK","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/the-kills","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Dreamy and feverish, hooky and repetitive, obsessive and claustrophobic – that’s The Kills’ fourth album, “Blood Pressures”. ‘Obsessive and claustro-phobic?’ repeats Jamie Hince: ‘yes, I like that.

I grew up as a dancer and I thought you had to dance to be a girl in the music industry. Then I saw the White Stripes and I was like, ‘No, you don’t. I can do that.’” Momsen was nine. \n<br /><br />\nJack White’s raw power and deceptively simple guitar-and-vocal attack proved to be highly influential on the now 16-year-old Momsen, who began humming melodies before she could talk and writing songs at the age of five after falling in love with The Beatles. “I was obsessed with them,” she says. “I also loved Led Zeppelin, The Who, Pink Floyd, Audioslave, Soundgarden, Oasis, and Nirvana. That’s what I listened to. My rock idols are all men.” \n<br /><br />\nSo it’s not surprising that Momsen channels a lot of masculine energy on LIGHT ME UP, her rock-and-roll-heroine-in-the-making debut album with her band The Pretty Reckless. The songs, all written by Momsen and Ben Phillips with their producer Kato Khandwala, run the gamut of emotions, alternating at times between seething rage and a bruised vulnerability. With Momsen’s inky vocals, pummeling riffs, and swaggering attitude, LIGHT ME UP sounds a bit like what might have happened had Led Zeppelin been fronted by “a chick.”  The album’s ferocity could raise an eyebrow from those expecting a pretty, blonde teenager to gravitate toward straight-up pop songwriting. “It’s heavier than people might expect from me,” says Momsen, who is best known as the actress who plays Jenny Humphrey on The CW’s Gossip Girl. “But this album is the most honest expression of who I truly am.”\n<br /><br />\nMomsen is a smart, emotionally complex young woman who has developed a strong identity despite growing up in the notoriously critical and fickle entertainment industry. Born and raised in St. Louis, MO, Taylor spent much of her time in NYC and at thirteen, she relocated to Manhattan. At two years old, Momsen signed to a modeling agency and a year later she began acting professionally appearing in commercials as well as films such as The Grinch Who Stole Christmas. In 2007 Momsen was cast as a lead in the CW show Gossip Girl. \n<br /><br />\n“I didn’t choose acting or modeling, I got thrown into it,” Momsen says. “I liked it, so that wasn’t a problem, but music and songwriting are what I’ve always really wanted to do. I’ve been working with producers and hanging out in recording studios since I was five, I just couldn’t put out an album when I was eight,” she says with a laugh. “Now I can.”\n<br /><br />\nLIGHT ME UP is an unflinchingly honest chronicle of Momsen’s experiences, filtered through her unique point of view. “The record is about life,” she says. “It covers everything: love, death, and music itself. It’s rock and roll. It’s sex. It’s drugs. It’s religion. It’s politics. Each song tells a story about the trials and tribulations and emotional struggles that I’ve experienced or observed. It’s not a happy pop record, but it’s not Satan-worshiping either. The lyrics aren’t meant to be taken literally, they are open to interpretation.”  \n<br /><br />\nThe songs tackle everything from romantic insecurity (the full-throttle rager “Make Me Wanna Die,” which also appears on the soundtrack to the film Kick-Ass), to despair (“You”), to how working non-stop can you make you feel like one of the un-dead (“Zombie”). Momsen pushes back against the haters on “Light Me Up” and asks how far you have to go to get forgiveness on “Going Down.” With her growly, world-weary alto, Momsen can do it all: garage-rock rave-ups (“Miss Nothing”), punchy blues-rock stompers (“My Medicine,” “Since You’re Gone”), as well as emotional power ballads (“Just Tonight”) and lovely acoustic guitar and string-driven numbers (“You”). \n<br /><br />\n “I’m not just writing something because I think people might like it,” Momsen says. “I hope they do, but I’m writing it because I have something to say. So many feelings go into the lyrics that it’s hard to explain what they’re about. Momsen first hooked up with Khandwala (Blondie, Drowning Pool, Paramore, Breaking Benjamin) and partner and songwriter, Phillips in October 2008.  By the spring of last year, they felt they had hit upon a sound that felt authentic to her.\n<br /><br />\n“The three of us have similar musical taste, so it was easy to find that singular vision,” Phillips says. “Kato and I worked very hard to help Taylor reach her potential because we could see how talented she was right off the bat. She went into the vocal booth and began to sing and we turned to each other and went, ‘Holy sh*t, she’s f**’ing great.’ Her voice was astonishing. So many artists these days let their voices be discombobulated by computers. Taylor doesn’t do that. She doesn’t need to. She can walk into a room and kick your ass.”   ","hometown":"New York, New York, US","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/the-pretty-reckless","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"One night several years ago, Taylor Momsen’s father took his daughter to a White Stripes show. “Before that, the only concert I’d been to was Britney Spears,” says the singer, songwriter, and guitarist. “But once I saw Jack White onstage, that was it.

In 2007 Momsen was cast as a lead in the CW show Gossip Girl. \n<br /><br />\n“I didn’t choose acting or modeling, I got thrown into it,” Momsen says. “I liked it, so that wasn’t a problem, but music and songwriting are what I’ve always really wanted to do. I’ve been working with producers and hanging out in recording studios since I was five, I just couldn’t put out an album when I was eight,” she says with a laugh. “Now I can.”\n<br /><br />\nLIGHT ME UP is an unflinchingly honest chronicle of Momsen’s experiences, filtered through her unique point of view. “The record is about life,” she says. “It covers everything: love, death, and music itself. It’s rock and roll. It’s sex. It’s drugs. It’s religion. It’s politics. Each song tells a story about the trials and tribulations and emotional struggles that I’ve experienced or observed. It’s not a happy pop record, but it’s not Satan-worshiping either. The lyrics aren’t meant to be taken literally, they are open to interpretation.”  \n<br /><br />\nThe songs tackle everything from romantic insecurity (the full-throttle rager “Make Me Wanna Die,” which also appears on the soundtrack to the film Kick-Ass), to despair (“You”), to how working non-stop can you make you feel like one of the un-dead (“Zombie”). Momsen pushes back against the haters on “Light Me Up” and asks how far you have to go to get forgiveness on “Going Down.” With her growly, world-weary alto, Momsen can do it all: garage-rock rave-ups (“Miss Nothing”), punchy blues-rock stompers (“My Medicine,” “Since You’re Gone”), as well as emotional power ballads (“Just Tonight”) and lovely acoustic guitar and string-driven numbers (“You”). \n<br /><br />\n “I’m not just writing something because I think people might like it,” Momsen says. “I hope they do, but I’m writing it because I have something to say. So many feelings go into the lyrics that it’s hard to explain what they’re about. Momsen first hooked up with Khandwala (Blondie, Drowning Pool, Paramore, Breaking Benjamin) and partner and songwriter, Phillips in October 2008.  By the spring of last year, they felt they had hit upon a sound that felt authentic to her.\n<br /><br />\n“The three of us have similar musical taste, so it was easy to find that singular vision,” Phillips says. “Kato and I worked very hard to help Taylor reach her potential because we could see how talented she was right off the bat. She went into the vocal booth and began to sing and we turned to each other and went, ‘Holy sh*t, she’s f**’ing great.’ Her voice was astonishing. So many artists these days let their voices be discombobulated by computers. Taylor doesn’t do that. She doesn’t need to. She can walk into a room and kick your ass.”   ","musicbrainz_id":null},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/15288/sq_90.JPG","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/15288/original.JPG","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/77973.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"9999","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"5"}},"main_lineup_position":"999","twitter_username":null,"setlist":"0","title":"The Q Brothers","updated_at":"2011-05-26 03:33:37 -0500","youtube_id":"VU1JCRr78IY","flickr_tag":"theqbrothers","id":"77973","echonest_id":null,"homepage":"http://www.qbrothers.com/","myspace_link":"http://www.myspace.com/qbrothers","fan_count":"4","description":"The Q Brothers are rappers and actors from Chicago who also run a hip hop workshop for kids of all ages.\n<br><br>\nThey are known around the globe for adapting Shakepeare's works into hip hop musicals. &nbsp;JQ is the producer/composer of all their music, and GQ is most recognizable for his work in the movie Drumline.\n<br><br>\nThey do what they love and they love what they do!","hometown":"SANTA MONICA, California, US","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/the-q-brothers","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"The Q Brothers are rappers and actors from Chicago who also run a hip hop workshop for kids of all ages.\n<br><br>\nThey are known around the globe for adapting Shakepeare's works into hip hop musicals. &nbsp;JQ is the producer/composer of all their music, and GQ is most recognizable for his work in the movie Drumline.\n<br><br>\nThey do what they love and they love what they do!","musicbrainz_id":null},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14919/sq_90.jpg","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14919/original.jpg","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/105248.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"54","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"5"}},"main_lineup_position":"2650","twitter_username":"thevaccines","setlist":null,"title":"The Vaccines","updated_at":"2011-05-17 03:14:55 -0500","youtube_id":"uQKjI6395iU","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/26707.json","title":"Friendly Fires"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/12647.json","title":"Arctic Monkeys"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/45355.json","title":"The Pains of Being Pure at Heart"}]},"flickr_tag":"thevaccines","id":"105248","echonest_id":"ARKJP2A1187FB41672","homepage":"http://www.thevaccines.co.uk/","myspace_link":"http://www.myspace.com/thevaccines","fan_count":"1234","description":"What Did You Expect From The Vaccines? is the debut album from The Vaccines. Eleven songs, eleven tones of excitement recorded “quickly and painlessly” in just under a month in London late last year at the hands of producer Dan Grech.\n<br /><br />\nIt’s a record that favours ‘the song’ over all other disciplines. It’s best articulated in one of the record’s shortest (and most dizzy) tunes, If You Wanna.\n<br /><br />\n“That song was the turning point,” explains Justin Young, lead singer of The Vaccines. “It crystallized what we were and where we were going. What followed was a process of shaving the songs down to their very essence”.\n<br /><br />\nIf You Wanna cuts through with a sharp simplicity, so much so that the demo version the band put online in the summer of 2010 was rapidly noticed.  It was a starting point for the band - Freddie Cowan (guitar), Arni Arnason (bass) and Pete Robertson (drums) who, alongside Justin finally kick-started The Vaccines in the spring of 2010 after a fair few months of rehearsals honing their sound.\n<br /><br />\n“We never set out with any sort of mission statement, but when we first started playing we quickly realised that through our shared love of the ‘perfect pop song’ there was a real bond, we all felt really invigorated and excited by the music we were making,” says Justin. “If there was ever any quest, it was to create direct pop music with depth and emotion, the sort of stuff that The Modern Lovers, The Velvet Underground and The Clash made sound so easy.”\n<br /><br />\n“A lot of the arrangements were much more complicated when the songs were conceived,” adds Justin. “But we got to a point where we were confident to just strip everything away. Being that direct seemed to carry so much more emotion.”\n<br /><br />\nAs Justin says: “some of The Vaccines songs sound simple, but making them sound like that is one of the most difficult things of all to do.”\n<br /><br />\nConsider the minute and half squeal of Nørgaard or debut single ‘\nWreckin Bar (Ra Ra Ra), songs that perfectly showcase the kick-and-rush-riffarama of The Vaccines’ default setting. They’re much like modern lullabies, songs that wiggle their way into your consciousness and won’t let go. \n<br /><br />\nOr the stuttering Wolf Pack or the bubblegum romance of Under Your Thumb; confident, headstrong songs that are testament to the young songwriter’s almost veteran status having written his first song aged eleven (“about girls and stuff, things I didn’t really understand”) and spent his teenage years in a variety of bands.\n<br /><br />\nYet The Vaccines debut isn’t just Ramones punch and Jesus and Mary Chain swagger. Blow It Up is all woozy eyed atmospherics, evocative on record as it was at its first London outing last October, at the bands Flowerpot show in London. Then there’s Wetsuit, more modern hymn than pop song, Freddie’s guitar coaxing rich colour out of the skeletal verse and big, brave choruses. “I’m always been more into sound than songs,” says the guitarist, younger brother of The Horrors’ Tom. “That’s what I bring to the band - texture”.\n<br /><br />\n“My favourite song on the record is Family Friend” says Arni of the record’s closing opus (in that at five, it’s a rare venture over the three minute mark). “I think it wraps the record up nicely, Justin’s lyrics are beautiful, but it ends the record on a question mark. Sort of like, this is what we do… but this is what we might do next.”\n<br /><br />\n“I want people to love the record like we do,” says Justin of this band’s debut, “but I want them to be as excited as I am about where The Vaccines go next too. I want them to join here and let us take them somewhere else. I’m excited about the next lot of songs I know I’ve got in me. I’m excited about what comes next.”\n<br /><br />\nWhat did you expect from The Vaccines? Excitement, thrills, melody, power, romance? You’ll find all contained within their debut. Yet perhaps the most exciting thing is that its contents signpost the next dose you can expect next from its creators.
